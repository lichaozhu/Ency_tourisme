Résumé. Cet article vise à définir un cadre d’évaluation de la compétitivité des destinations touristiques jouissant
d’un solide patrimoine culturel (tangible ou intangible) et ayant retenu des modèles de développement centrés
sur les industries culturelles et créatives locales. À partir d’une solide analyse de la littérature scientifique, tant
italienne qu’internationale, sur les destinations touristiques à fort patrimoine culturel, il évalue l’impact des
industries créatives sur le développement régional. Le modèle ainsi établi constituera un outil au service de
l’élaboration de politiques de gestion coordonnées et globales des destinations touristiques créatives. Cette
recherche a également pour ambition de grossir la littérature sur la gestion des destinations car, si ce fonds est
fourni au niveau international, il est relativement pauvre en études approfondies sur le patrimoine culturel et sur
les liens entre industries culturelles et créatives, d’une part, et processus de développement local, d’autre part.
Ainsi, bien que s’appuyant sur des travaux apportant un accroissement marginal de la connaissance, cette
recherche vise à établir un cadre très novateur. Une fois les résultats escomptés obtenus, ce cadre non seulement
contribuera au débat scientifique, mais accompagnera aussi les politiques des destination touristiques.
Abstract. The aim of this paper is to identify an interpretative framework for the competitiveness of tourism destinations
defined by a strong tangible or intangible cultural heritage and which have identified development patterns focused
around local cultural and creative industries. This paper will analyse in depth both Italian and international literature
on tourist destinations with a strong cultural heritage, evaluating the implications of creative industries for regional
development. The resulting model will help to develop a coordinated and comprehensive management policy for
creative tourism destinations. This research aims at contributing to the literature on destination management, which,
whilst extensive at an international level, is relatively scarce for in-depth studies on cultural heritage and the relationship
between cultural and creative industries and local development processes. For these reasons, although the approach
to this work can only be based upon marginal increases in knowledge, it aims at setting out a new and highly innovative
framework. Achieving the desired results will contribute not only to the scientific debate on the subject, but also
support regional development initiatives as defined by tourist destination policies.
