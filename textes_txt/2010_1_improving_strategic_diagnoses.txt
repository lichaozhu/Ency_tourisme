IMPROVING STRATEGIC DIAGNOSES TO FOSTER THE MUTATION OF TOURISM DESTINATIONS • CORINNE VAN DER YEUGHT

S

ince the mid-1990s, a growing number of tourism destinations have opted for sustainable development strategies in
order to face the economic, social
and environmental issues of tourism in their territories (Bensahel
and Donsimoni, 1999; Ritchie and
Crouch, 2000; Van der Yeught, 2008).
These destinations aim at achieving a satisfactory balance between economic prosperity, social
equity and the preservation of their
natural heritage in order to ensure
visitor satisfaction within an intensely competitive context. Once
engaged, the sustainable development process requires a thorough
analysis of the complexity of territories and of tourism phenomena,
which calls for a renewal of existing analytical frameworks through
the cross-fertilization with the different disciplines.
This paper adopts a strategic
management perspective. Its starting point is that destinations, just
like firms, strive to be competitive. Its purpose is to answer the
following question: How can organisations that manage tourism destinations produce strategic diagn o s e s th at in c lu d e b o th
competitiveness and sustainability
constraints? A resource-based strategic approach leads to the identification of rare resources and
core competencies because they
may generate sustainable competitive advantages (SCA) (Barney,
1991). From this perspective, the
paper intends to build a typology
of strategic resources that can help
destination leaders achieve their
competitive and sustainable objectives.
The research follows four steps.
First, the paper examines the issues
related to the sustainability and
competitiveness of destinations
and it suggests applying the
60

resource-based view (RBV) framework to the question of sustainable destination management.
Second, the methodological options
ar e c lar ifie d an d th e th r e e
Mediterranean destinations under
empirical study are presented: the
To u lo n Me tr o p o litan Ar e a
(TMA)(1), the Frioul Islands (both
situated between the French Riviera
and the Provence region), and the
Cinque Terre National Park (on
the Italian Riviera). Third, the
enquiry identifies the criteria for
a synthetic conceptual typology
of sustainable strategic resources.
Fourth, the following strategic diagnosis methodology is applied to
the destinations under study to
make sure it is supported by facts.
The conclusion discusses the study’s results.

A RESOURCE-BASED
APPROACH TO ANALYSE
SUSTAINABILITY-DRIVEN
TOURISM DESTINATIONS
The concept of sustainability

The origins of sustainable development (SD), as a popularly engaged construct, can be traced back
to the World Commission on
Environment and Development
Report (WCED, 1987), also known
as Brundtland Report, which
defines SD as a type of development that meets the needs of the
present without compromising the
ability of future generations to
meet their own needs. The concept
of SD was further popularised in
1992 thanks to the Rio Earth
Summit, and to the Agenda 21
programme thereafter. This concept
is both complex and multi-dimensional. It reaches beyond the
contradiction summarised in the
concept of eco-development (Sachs,
1980, 1997) by introducing a social
dimension in the development

issue. Basically, SD should aim at
three main interconnected objectives (the three main ‘pillars’ of
sustainability): robust economic
growth, ecological viability and
social equity. In accordance with
the third objective, development
should be concerned with issues
of intragenerational equity (within
a given generation, everyone should
enjoy equitable access to resources
and obtain their fair share of
wealth) and intergenerational
equity (for the benefit of future
generations, the impacts of economic activities on natural capital should be controlled in order
to ensure long-term economic
growth and human survival itself).
To address the social pillar of sustainability, Amartya Sen’s notion
of ‘capabilities’ (Sen, 1991) and
John Rawls’s ‘theory of justice’
(Rawls, 1987) could be of great interest in qualifying these activities
that may lead to social sustainable
development (Dubois et Mahieu,
2002; Rajaona Daka et Dubois, 2008).
The major applications of the
concept of sustainability to the
tourism industry date back to the
1990s and the first definitions of
sustainable tourism were derived
from the more general concept of
SD. In 1995, the Charter for
Sustainable Tourism of Lanzarote
stipulated that ‘a requirement of
sound management of tourism is
that the sustainability of the
resources on which it depends must
be guaranteed’. It also advocated
th e ‘glo b al man age me n t o f
resources so as to ensure their viability’.
Mo r e r e c e n tly, th e Wo r ld
Tourism Organization (2004) formulated a fairly explicit conceptual definition which insists on (i)
the optimal use of environmental
resources; (ii) the respect of the
socio-cultural authenticity of host

RECHERCHE • VARIA

communities; (iii) the necessity for
tourism activities to ensure viable
and long-term economic operations, providing for the participation of all the relevant stakeholders, as well as strong political
leadership to ensure wide participation and consensus building;
and (iv) the ability to maintain a
high level of tourist satisfaction.
This definition refers to ‘sociocultural authenticity’ without really
identifying ‘culture’ as one of the
pillars of sustainability. Yet, it may
be useful to distinguish clearly between the ‘cultural’ and ‘social’ criteria of sustainability, if sustainable tourism is to be implemented.
The competitiveness
of tourism destinations

Although the growth rates in
the tourism industry are still high
and should remain so in the future
(WTO, 1999), escalating competition among destinations leads
many of them to seek to improve
their competitiveness while trying
to take into account the long-term
effects of tourism activities in a
sustainable perspective (Ritchie and
Crouch, 2000).
The concept of competitiveness
and the related concept of competitive advantage are central to
strategic management. Although,
these are complex and multifaceted concepts that cannot lead to
universally accepted definitions
(Crouch and Ritchie, 1999), they are
generally defined as the ability of
an organisation to generate higher
performance than its competitors.
From a strategic point of view, the
competitive advantage is ‘sustained’ when the value-creating strategy that generates it cannot be
imitated or duplicated by any current or potential competitor (Barney,
1991, p. 102).
A significant part of strategic

management literature has sought
to identify competitiveness factors
depending on the micro or macro
level of the analysis. Porter (1980)
built the value chain model to analyse the roots of competitive advantage at the firm’s level and, to
address competition at the national level, he proposed the diamond
of competitive advantage (1990).
Porter’s advances paved the way
for scholars dealing with the competitiveness of tourism destinations. Thus, Flagestad and Hope
(2001, p. 449) conceptualised a destination as a ‘collection of interrelated economic activities’, then
they proposed ‘the value fan’ model
in which they distinguished between the primary and the support
activities that compose a destination’s value chain. The primary
activities are related to the creation of the destination’s tourism
products and to the transfer of
value to the visitors (via hotels,
restaurants, transport and other
services), while the support activities contribute to the success of
the primary activities, for example,
by providing infrastructure, overall destination planning and the
management of sustainability.
Building on Porter’s diamond
of national competitiveness (1990),
Ritchie and Crouch (2000, 2003)
developed a framework where they
identified the basic sources of competitiveness and sustainability at
the destination level. First, the
authors made a distinction between comparative advantage,
which results from a destination’s
factor endowments, both natural
and created, and competitive
advantage, which lies in these strategic processes that allow tourism
resources to be used efficiently.
Then, the authors presented a
model which is based on five components: (i) ‘supporting factors

and resources’; (ii) ‘core resources
and attractors’; (iii) ‘destination
management’; (iv) ‘qualifying determinants’; and (v) ‘tourism policy’.
Within this fifth component, they
recommended an audit of the destination’s existing tourism resources
and capabilities before making
strategic decisions.
Other publications, which are
centred on the competitiveness of
territories, offer methodologies
that can help leaders define motivating and effective sustainable
development strategies (LEADER,
1997, 1999; Teyssandier and Zysberg,
2000; Perret, Teyssandier and Marette,
2001; Céron and Dubois, 2002; Perret,
Teyssandier and Baldié, 2006).
The LEADER (1999) methodology opted for a comprehensive
view of the competitiveness of rural
territories engaged in sustainable
evolutions. Prior to building a territory-development scheme, it
recommended an analysis of its
territorial capital in eight points:
(1) the territory’s physical resources
and their management; (2) its culture and identity; (3) human
resources; (4) competencies and
know how; (5) governance; (6)
economic activities; (7) markets
and external relations; and (8) the
territory’s image and the public
perception thereof.
The methodology proposed by
Perret, Teyssandier and Marette
(2001) gave priority to the actors
of tourism and suggested that
contradictory diagnoses be realised in order to take local diversity constraints into account. Sets
of indicators are also thought to
be useful to assess destinations’
advances in terms of sustainable
development (Perret, Teyssandier and
Marette, 2001; Céron and Dubois,
2002; WTO, 2004). However, experiments carried out in France have
shown that leaders tend to adapt

61

IMPROVING STRATEGIC DIAGNOSES TO FOSTER THE MUTATION OF TOURISM DESTINATIONS • CORINNE VAN DER YEUGHT

existing approaches to local requirements. Examples include the
method proposed by Perret,
Teyssandier and Marette (2001),
which has never been thoroughly
applied, and the contradictory diagnoses and batteries of indicators
which have never been put to use
(Perret, Teyssandier and Baldié, 2006).
As the literature review will
show, the issues related to the strategic assessment of territories and
destinations have already been
built into different methodological constructions. However, how
can we determine which listed criteria best apply to a given territo r y? C an th e s e d iffe r e n t
approaches be combined into a
single comprehensive and more
manageable model without overlooking the destinations’ inherent
complexities? To answer these
questions, this paper intends to
draw lessons from the RBV.
A conceptualisation
of tourism destinations
derived from the RBV

Many definitions of tourism destinations have been proposed. Most
of them focus on the territorial
characteristics of the destination
and on its capacity to attract and
satisfy visitors. Flagestad and Hope
(2001) referred to Penrose’s seminal work (1959) to define a destination as ‘a bundle of resources’,
but they do not investigate further
in this theoretical direction. Now,
resources are central in a sustainable perspective and from a strategic point of view. Not only are
they powerful attractive factors
for the visitors, but they also
influence the latter’s satisfaction
while they experiment the tourism
products. So, this paper is founded on the main advances of the
RBV.
In the resource-based perspec62

M O N D E S D U TO U R I S M E N ° 1 • J U I N 2 0 1 0

tive, a tourism destination can be
conceptualised as a collection of
productive and human, tangible
and intangible resources that may
lead to a sustained competitive
advantage (Penrose, 1959; Barney,
1991). The capital of resources
available in the destination at any
given time results from the investments that were made in the past
(Dierickx and Cool, 1989) because
most of the attractive resources of
a destination, such as the historical and cultural heritage, the natural environment, the landscapes,
the reputation for quality and so
forth, have required time and
human effort to achieve their current state. These specific assets are
the cumulative results of the community’s evolution over time and
they play a crucial part in a destination’s success. So, in accordance with the evolutionary principle of path dependency, the
strategic choices made in the past
may constrain the destination’s
evolution in the future (Dosi et al.,
1990). In their attempt to explain
why major companies’ diversification strategies are consistent with
their history, Dosi et al. (1990)
observed that ‘history matters’,
which means that the specificity
o f an o r gan is atio n ’s as s e ts
influences its strategic evolution.
However, the concept of path
dependency does not foreclose
future options because branching
out remains a possibility through
organisational learning and competitive pressure. The methodology of LEADER programmes (1999)
emphasised the strategic importance of the territories’ historical
dimension because it reveals much
about their identities, their present situations and their potential
evolutions in the future.
In the RBV, the resulting heterogeneity between destinations

may lead to a sustained competitive advantage if the resource system is valuable (it exploits opportunities and/or neutralises threats
from the business environment),
rare, imperfectly imitable, and if
there cannot be strategically equivalent substitutes for it (Barney,
1991). In this perspective, the purpose of strategic management
consists in identifying, preserving,
using and creating these resources
which may generate competitive
advantages, precisely because they
are rare (Arrègle, 2006).

METHODOLOGY
Research design

The empirical inquiry is based
on a case studies research strategy,
which is recommended in order to
understand complex social phenomena when a ‘why’ or ‘how’
question is being asked about a
contemporary set of events in unexplored research areas (Yin, 2003;
Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007).
According to Yin (2003, p. 13), ‘a
case study is an empirical inquiry
that investigates a contemporary
phenomenon within its real-life
context, especially when the boundaries between phenomenon and
context are not clearly evident’.
Multiple-case studies allow for the
replication of the results while
strengthening their external validity. Contrary to quantitative
research strategies, the sampling
of cases in qualitative research is
not statistical, but analytical. In
this study, the selection of cases
was determined in order to enhance
the generalisability of the diagnosis tools in the making: the selected destinations are all involved in
sustainable tourism strategies and
located in developed countries.
As far as data collection is
concerned, case studies rely on mul-

RECHERCHE • VARIA

tiple sources of evidence with data
needing to converge in a triangulation fashion (Yin, 2003). The data
collected in this study come from
many sources of evidence, as explained in table 1, which summarises
the main steps of the research and
the data collection procedure.
First, an exploratory step consisted in examining academic and institutional literature in order to
understand what the destinations’
managers understood by sustainability and which strategic assets
best explain their strategic success.
Second, three destinations engaged in sustainable strategies were
investigated more thoroughly: the
Toulon Metropolitan Area (TMA),
the Frioul Islands and the Cinque
Terre National Park. In each of the
surveyed cases, the relevant
resources of competitiveness and
sustainability were identified. In
reference to the different methodological approaches proposed in
academic and institutional literature, the case studies led to the
identification of three relevant criteria to classify sustainable strategic resources in order to make sure
the proposed model could be properly applied.
Each type of resource was coded.
Collected data were then restructured into matrixes and charts following the recommendations of
Miles and Huberman (2003) (see
models in section 3, tables 2 to 5).
Then, the results were given to the
destinations’ leaders for them to
amend, complement or validate.

articles provided twenty significant examples of strategies based
on sustainable tourism. The
authors of the support documents
generally considered that these
strategies were successful. They
described the driving forces behind
each project and they presented
the results that had been obtained: the creation of new sustainable tourism activities, the improvement of the quality of tourism
services, the rehabilitation of traditional settlements, the protection of the natural environment,
the management of networks to
implement sustainable tourism,
etc. Some of these documents refer-

red to difficulties in managing the
networks. However, most of them
rather focused on the general
attainments than on specific quantitative results. Because this part
of the study was based on a literature review, obtaining more accurate information proved difficult.
As a remedy to these shortcomings,
an in-depth analysis was carried
out, between 2004 and 2010, on
three Mediterranean destinations
while they were implementing sustainable development strategies.

article was given permission to
participate in the sustainable tour is m p r o je c ts (Su b me d an d
Vistoria) during their implementation, between January 2004 and
October 2006. She kept in regular touch with the programme leaders thereafter. TMA was created
in January 2002 to meet the requirements of several French national devolution acts, which encour age th e d e ve lo p me n t o f
joint-venture partnerships between
cities. Eleven municipalities in the
Toulon area agreed to form the
TMA cluster that extends from
the Mediterranean seaboard to the
Provence region. In January 2004,
the new entity was still unfamiliar to the population and it needed financial funds to invest in
local development policy. In this
context, the strategy managers
decided to join two European sustainable tourism programmes
(Interreg III B and C): Submed, to
promote sustainable scuba diving
activities in the Mediterranean Sea,
and Vistoria, to develop tourist
itineraries highlighting scenic and
historical resources. Within the
Vistoria programme, TMA was in
charge of designing methods to
promote the historical and natural heritage of the nine European
participating destinations. The
investigation resulted in diagnosis tools that assess the strategic
assets of the destination from a
s u s tain ab le p o in t o f vie w.
Thereafter, this diagnosis framework was tested and improved
thanks to the Frioul Islands case.
• THE LABORATORY CASE: THE
FRIOUL ISLANDS. The Marseilles
urban community is involved in
an ambitious sustainable development strategy for all its seaboard areas. The programme
includes the Frioul Islands where
64

the local authorities intend to develop sustainable tourism projects.
Given the small size of this archipelago (two hundred hectares), the
Frioul Islands were selected as a
laboratory case for this research
experiment. Since 1971, the archipelago has been managed by the
public authorities of the Marseilles
Township after private investors
failed to manage the site properly.
One hundred people live full-time
on the islands and they need to
reach the continent in order to
benefit from different kinds of
amenities like schooling, medical
services, employment, shopping,
and so on. Although the tourists
and local inhabitants are really
fond of the place, tourism facilities are scarce. Most visitors access
the archipelago on their private
yachts and they sleep on board.
The local authorities hope to make
the Frioul Islands a show-case of
Marseilles’ know-how regarding
sustainability and, with that intent,
they decided to organise a decision-forum where citizens, business managers, association leaders
and public institution leaders were
invited to express their views. This
case study permitted the completion of the methodology of the
pilot case’s strategic diagnosis,
especially in its environmental and
social dimensions. In the following
stage of this survey, the tools of
the strategic diagnosis have been
tested and refined on the Cinque
Terre National Park, which is one
of the most advanced sustainable
tourism ventures examined in this
paper.
• T HE EXEMPLARY CASE : T HE
CINQUE TERRE NATIONAL PARK
(C T NP ). Th e C in q u e Te r r e
National Park (CTNP) originally
featured in the exploratory study.
It provided a wealth of informa-

tion that justified further investigation. The local authorities agreed
to be interviewed, first by e-mail,
then in face-to-face meetings. This
case is qualified as ‘exemplary’
because the destination’s leaders
have reached ambitious sustainability objectives since the creation
of the park in 1999, thanks to an
original governance system. The
CTNP is situated on the Ligurian
sea-board, south of the port of
Genova. This protected natural
area was included in the UNESCO
environmental and cultural world
heritage list in 1997. It qualified
as a protected marine area in 1997
and as a national park in 1999.
The cliffs fall vertically into the
Ligurian Sea and the rocky coastline stands out as one of Italy’s
most attractive landscapes. The
scenery was modelled by men who,
over a thousand years, painstakingly transformed the steep slopes
into farming terraces and vineyards
where the famous Sciachettrà wine
is produced. Starting in the 1960s,
modern roads encouraged young
people to leave the five isolated
villages to find jobs in the neighbouring cities and brought more
tourists. However, as farming activities disappeared, the area’s terraced landscape quickly fell into
decay, putting inhabitants and tourists at risk. The local authorities’
reaction was to develop a sustainable tourism strategy with the
aim of creating jobs in order to
encourage the inhabitants to
remain in the villages and of
controlling the impacts of tourism.
Ten years after the creation of the
protected area, the local authorities have already reached many of
their initial objectives. The Park’s
chairman is encouraged by the success of his strategy and hopes ‘to
sustain the development of the
area over one or two centuries at

least’(2). The park’s outstanding
achievements permitted the completion of the classification system of strategic resources, especially in its economic and social
dimensions.

A CONCEPTUAL
TYPOLOGY OF SUSTAINABLE
STRATEGIC RESOURCES
The first step when analysing a
destination’s strategy is to list and
measure all those resources which
are relevant from a competitiveness and sustainability perspective. Because of the large number
of proposals found in the literature, it is vital to determine which
criteria best apply to the destinations under study. This paper selects
the three following criteria.
The first criterion of resources
classification: the four pillars
of tourism sustainability

Experts generally identify the
three pillars of sustainability as
the economic, the social and the
environmental pillars. However,
the case studies have revealed that
a fourth pillar, the cultural one, is
of crucial importance to measure
a territory’s path dependency, to
define its identity and to determin e its s tr ate gic p o s itio n .
Therefore, although the two dimensions are generally merged in the
literature (WTO, 2004), the typology of resources proposed in this
paper distinguishes between the
social and cultural dimensions and
specifies their different contents.
The economic and environmental dimensions are the most
widely quoted in the exploratory
case studies. The economic pillar
is illustrated through several activities, some of which are recurrent in the case studies: new profit-generating tourism products,

quality labels for tourism businesses, job-inducing activities, additional income in poor areas, extension of the tourist season, creation
of networks to implement sustainable tourism.
The environmental pillar is also
central in most exploratory case
studies, mainly in relation to the
economic one. Environmental sustainability may assume different
forms, such as new environmentfriendlier activities, eco-labels, environment management, waste
reduction and energy-saving programmes, renewable energies,
water management, the preservation of the natural heritage, environment-friendlier transport,
human-powered mobility, the
reduction of pollution and greenhouse gases, landscape conservation and soil erosion control.
As regards the social and cultural dimensions, official definitions do not clearly distinguish
between the two (cf. supra). Yet,
both notions appear to be sufficiently significant to justify separate approaches and specific clarifications. Culture refers to
symbols. In the field of management science, Hofstede (2001, p. 1)
defines culture as a ‘collective programming of the mind’, which
‘manifests itself not only in values,
but in more superficial ways: in
symbols, heroes, and rituals’. The
mental programming processes of
a given human group cannot be
observed in daily life, but they can
be captured through the artefacts
produced by its members. Thus,
in tourism destinations, cultural
sustainability refers to different
activities which aim at promoting
the community’s artefacts and
values. In the exploratory case studies, such activities may be: preserving the historical and archite c tu r al h e r itage , r e s to r in g

traditional settlements, promoting
the community’s arts and crafts,
marketing local food and wine,
and creating special events and
entertainments. These cultural
assets contribute to a destination’s
competitiveness and sustainability, because they make it more
attractive and unique when compared to rival destinations.
As far as the social pillar is
concerned, we may resort to three
concepts developed by Amartya
Sen and John Rawls in their
attempt to improve social justice:
accessibility and capability enhancement (Sen, 1991), and equity
(Rawls, 1987). In our framework,
these concepts may be applied to
various target groups: the tourists,
the local communities, and the
employees and the managers of
tourism companies. The accessibility criterion is derived from Sen
(1991), who frequently identifies
free movement (and safety and
security as its prerequisites) as one
of the basic human rights. Now,
because many people are deprived of tourism consumption by
health or financial problems, the
accessibility criterion has been
selected to account for destinations’ efforts to respect their visitors’ rights to unrestricted access,
especially when vulnerable visitors are concerned. For the disabled, access can be made easier
thanks to appropriate infrastructure and services. For instance, the
CTNP has designed specific activities for handicapped visitors. For
financially-challenged persons,
cheap accommodation may facilitate access to tourism destinations. For example, the only referenced accommodation provider
in the Frioul archipelago (except

The capability-enhancement criterion is also derived from Sen
(1991): the aim of any economic
policy should be to develop people’s capabilities to expand their
freedom. Educational programmes
and vocational training fulfil these
objectives and enable participants
to make a new start in life. The
case studies show that the tourists, the local community and the
people working in the tourism
industry may benefit from edu66

cational initiatives.
The equity criterion is one of
Rawls’s Theory of Justice’s central
concepts (1987). Rawls regards
equity as one of the constant
concerns of institutions. Indeed, it
helps answer the compelling
dilemma faced by all social organisations: individuals have to cooperate to maximise their mutual interests and the fruits of their common
productive efforts have to be shared fairly. Consequently, the issue

of distributive justice proves to be
particularly crucial in the tourism
industry. For example, in the Cinque
Terre case, profits from tourism
generated through the park’s turnover pay for ‘Quality of Life’ initiatives.
The second criterion of resources
classification: the inherited or
created character of the resources

The second criterion used to classify strategic resources aims at identifying the destinations’ path dependencies in order to determine future
strategic options consistent with
their history. This criterion was
developed during the Vistoria project (pilot case) with the help of
several historians. Their mission
was to design a common methodology to promote the natural and
historical resources of the partner
destinations. The approach they
suggested was to list and to date
the area’s different cultural resources
and to explain how the landscapes
had changed in history. Tourist discovery routes were developed from
these data with two objectives: first,
they were to publicise the community’s identity by promoting its
cultural artefacts and its ‘uniqueness’; second, the routes’ visitors
could enjoy new experiences by
discovering the destination’s authentic heritage. The purpose of the
second classification criterion,
drawn from the Vistoria historians’
approach, is to capture the evolutionary processes that have generated the destination.
To understand what Penrose
(1959) called ‘the direction of expansion’, it is vital to measure at any
given time the stock of the ‘inherited resources’ that are transmitted by past generations. Now, the
mix of the resources which are available at any given time within a
destination results from flows and

RECHERCHE • VARIA

stocks dynamics (Dierickx and Cool,
1989) that require the development
of new resources and strategies.
So, the second classification criterion separates ‘inherited resources’
from ‘created ones’, as suggested
by Ritchie and Crouch (2003, p. 23).
Inherited resources may be defined as the natural and historical
material passed on to the living
generations by the path dependency
process. These inherited resources
fit precisely into the ‘resource
endowments’ category as defined
by Ritchie and Crouch (2000, 2003).
They include both natural resources,
such as weather characteristics,
geography, hydrography, wildlife
and flora, etc., and resources crafted by past generations such as old
industrial plants, historically-significant businesses, local traditions,
typical architecture, historical and
cultural attractions, etc.
On the other hand, created
resources result from the ongoing
activities of present generations
and they widely depend on their
competences. In our framework,
created resources incorporate competences into a set of elementary
resources so as to develop sustainable tourism. For example, wildlife and flora are classified as environmental inherited resources
whereas protected areas and zoos
fall into the created resources category since they resort to scientific
know-how to manage, at the present time, the destination’s natural
heritage. Similarly, the destination’s
old industrial plants and historically-significant businesses (for
example vintage hotels, historical
cafés) are classified as economic
inherited resources because they
are not competitive tourist activities as such. To qualify as created
resources, they need to be combined with human knowledge, capital resources and tourism compe-

tences to contribute to the destination’s competitiveness (Ritchie
and Crouch, 2003). Admittedly, certain cases of hybridisation may
occasionally occur and blur the distinction between the two resource
categories. However, because developing resources and competences
is a dynamic process, resource hybridisation is generally temporary and
does not justify giving up the distinction altogether. This distinction

introduces a dynamic element in
the basically static classification
system. It clearly brings out the
path dependency of the destination, and helps define new strategic options which are consistent
with past choices.

is derived from Porterian terminology. It helps distinguish between ‘primary’ and ‘support’
resources. As seen in the literature
review, in order to analyse the roots
of competitive advantage at the
firm’s level, Porter (1980) built the
value chain model where he distinguished between the primary
and support activities and Flagestad
and Hope (2001) used the Porterian
distinction to conceptualise a destination’s value chain (the valuefan model). This paper suggests
applying the Porterian terminology not simply to economic activities but also to environmental,
social and cultural resources. In
our construction, the primary
resources characterise the major
assets of a destination as a tourist
attraction. These assets create value
for visitors either as unique attractions or combined with others. On
the other hand, support resources
relay and complement the attractive power of the primary resources.
They often play a vital role in the
production of sustainable value
without being attractive themselves.
From that perspective, tourist
accommodation and entertainment
facilities are classified as ‘economic created primary resources’,
while ancillary collective services,
which are used by tourists but are
not part of the tourism industry
(public transport, banking services,
medical care) fall into the ‘economic support resources’ category.
These support resources only create
value for visitors when combined
with primary resources.
The various sustainable tourism
strategic resources can be listed
and grouped following the format
proposed in tables 2 to 5, whose
content is fed by the case studies.
The typology is the groundwork
of the strategic diagnosis methodology.

THE SUSTAINABLE
STRATEGIC DIAGNOSIS
OF DESTINATIONS
The second step when analysing a destination’s strategy is to
build the destination’s diagnosis
by designing a matrix of its
strengths and weaknesses as exemplified in tables 6 to 8. Then, the
destination’s strengths and weaknesses clearly appear, the path
dependency can be identified and
strategic options can be formulated in order to implement successful projects.
The sustainable strategic diagnosis
of TMA

In the TMA case study, the territory’s heterogeneity calls for a
strategy reinforcing the attractiveness of the more deprived townships, while consolidating the existing assets of the two more mature
tourism centres (in the eastern and
western parts of the territory).
These two poles enjoy rich cultural and natural assets (on land and
sea). They also benefit from the
scientific expertise acquired in
oceanographic fields of study by
the National Park of Port-Cros
(the first French sea park opened
in 1963) and by the Institut
Océanographique Paul Ricard
(established in 1966). However,
tourism facilities are unevenly distributed and generally substandard (mostly open air camping
sites). The destination’s brand
image is poor (little value for
money) and its management is
multi-layered and inefficient.
The results of the strategic analysis handed over to the territory’s advanced planning committe e r e c o mme n d e d fo u r n o n
mutually exclusive operational
options: (1) set up theme routes

to promote the territory’s natural
resources, especially in the neglected areas; (2) improve the positioning of the site as a sea destination; (3) increase the territory’s
‘social’ sustainability (facilitate
access for physically-challenged
visitors, help seasonal workers find
accommodation, develop higher
education); and (4) delayer and
reorganise the destination’s management structure.
Understanding the territory’s
history reveals some of its liabilities and clarifies why certain
choices were made. The study
shows that Toulon’s difficulties in
developing as a seaside resort date
back to the 17th century, when
Colbert decided to turn the town
into France’s premier naval base
while Marseilles was to specialise
in commercial shipping. This political decision is at the beginning
of a path dependency that still has
far-reaching effects on the current
developing prospects of the two
main French Mediterranean sea
ports. At present, the French Navy
is relinquishing a growing number of its properties in the Toulon
Bay Area and the civilian authorities are taking over many fortified strongholds from the military.
These forts (there are about thirty
of them) add fresh value to the
destination’s cultural heritage. Since
its inception in 2002, TMA has
invested heavily in order to restore them one by one and has included them into visitors’ sightseeing
programmes. This has come as a
preliminary step to the Vistoria
programme, which aims at channelling evenly the flows of visitors
over the territory’s area thanks to
new tourism theme routes.
The territory’s recent history
also shows that developing scuba
diving activities is consistent with
the territory’s past. Indeed, the

tive policies for its protection.
Consequently, the study confirms
the relevance of the Vistoria and
Submed programmes.
The Vistoria programme resulted in a series of additional theme
tours which aim to promote the
destination’s various assets (gardens, landscapes, health care
centres, ‘Belle Époque’ walk paths,

artists and painters’ favourite spots,
vintage buildings). The classification of the cultural resources, which
is presented in this article, was
included in the common methodological framework of the programme’s European partners.
Similarly, Submed sponsored the
creation of two underwater marine
life discovery paths, fitted sixteen

scuba diving sites with environment-friendly mooring equipment
and contributed to the design of

backups. In 2010, Submed’s success and fame among tourism operators encouraged TMA to propose expertise transfers to other
countries as an international cooperation scheme. A Submed 2 application file is currently being processed by the French and European
authorities. Nonetheless, certain
issues related to the destination’s
social and managerial dimensions
could not be studied in depth since
they fall under the jurisdiction of
higher administrative echelons than
that of TMA.
The sustainable strategic diagnosis
of the Frioul area

In the case of the Frioul area,
the economic dimension has clearly
been neglected. Since the 1970s,
the Marseilles municipality has
managed the archipelago and
favoured the social, cultural and
environmental dimensions while
downplaying economic development. Except for a single social
tourism structure, accommodation is scarce and the marina is
inadequate to meet present needs.
However, any potential development venture may affect the environment and faces strong opposition. On the social level, the
Marseilles municipality encouraged many non profit associations
to develop youth educational programmes and work reinsertion initiatives for deprived persons. On
the environmental level, the site
has benefited from a preservation
scheme managed by the CEEP, a
conservatory devoted to the study
of the Provence area ecosystems,
which has carried out several surveys of the archipelago’s wildlife
and flora. On the cultural level,

several work insertion programmes
help restoring the site’s historical
heritage, notably the Lazaret and
the Caroline hospital which used
to be Marseilles’ quarantine confinement stations. In the summer,
cultural events are staged on the
Caroline site, although not on a
regular basis.
The analysis handed over to the
Frioul Project managers identified
three prospective evolutions: (1)
develop tourism accommodation;
(2) develop sea and land ecotourism activities; and (3) improve
the management of cultural attractions. For political and financial
reasons, delays have affected the
project. Ongoing negotiations
concerning the Parc National des
Calanques (a sea-board national
park project) may jeopardise new
accommodation developments,
while plans for an International
Conference Centre may turn the
Caroline site into a vibrant cultural centre.
The sustainable strategic diagnosis
of the Cinque Terre National Park

In the park’s tourism development strategy, the four dimensions
of sustainability are taken into
account. The strategic analysis
reveals the park’s numerous assets
but it also pinpoints some weaknesses that may lead to future developments.
The site’s major attractiveness
results from a centuries-old combination of nature and culture
whose unique blend determines
the park’s strategic orientations.
The Cinque Terre has been listed
in the World Heritage List as a
‘cultural site of outstanding value,
representing the harmonious interaction between people and nature
to produce a landscape of exceptional scenic quality’ (UNESCO, 1997).
However, if the territory had not

been intensively protected, its natural path dependency would probably have led to its demise.
Although tourism was first perceived as a risk factor, it has become
a top priority to boost local economic development.
Every year, more than one million tourists visit the park, mainly
for hiking and scuba diving. Most
tourism businesses (90% of tourism structures) are involved in
the eco-quality brand processes,
which provide for routine assessment of visitors’ satisfaction, and
agriculture remains the mainstay
of the local economic development.
As far as the natural environment is concerned, much has been
achieved: preserved areas, organic farming and ecotourism activities. Car driving is banned in the
villages: visitors walk or use the
tr ain o r e le c tr ic al b u s e s .
Nevertheless, the park’s office must
improve waste management procedures and the inland access for
tourists who generally remain on
the coast.
The ‘Quality of Life’ programme
is a plus in the social dimension.
The funds generated by tourism
pay for free public transport for
residents, old age care, a crèche
and a school. The CTNP has also
designed specific activities for handicapped visitors: an underwater
marine life discovery trail can be
accessed by blind persons; sea
outings are proposed for mentally
incapacitated children, where they
can communicate with the dolphins that live freely in the sea
mammals marine sanctuary; and
a horse-riding club hires qualified
instructors who look after certain
mentally or physically handicapped visitors. The park’s most popular r amb lin g p ath , la Via
dell’Amore, is wheelchair accesJ U I N 2 0 1 0 • M O N D E S D U TO U R I S M E N ° 1

sible and is equipped with lifts to
facilitate the access of disabled
visitors to the coastal trail network. However, the social dimension is negatively affected by the
park’s economic conditions because
the Cinque Terre remains an expensive destination for people of
modest means. Cheap accommodation is scarce – there are two
youth hostels in all – and no
accommodation is available for
season workers. Finally, the cultural dimension is limited to local
history, cooking and winemaking.
The park has no museum. The
chairman sees the park as a
hothouse of sustainable projects,
but he is deeply concerned by the
park’s weaknesses: in his view, a
lot has been achieved but much
remains to be done.
*
*
In recent years, as tourism was
developing globally, a significant
number of destination leaders have
been increasingly concerned about
competitiveness and sustainability
issues. They have seen them both
as necessary to implement the inevitable mutation towards sustainability. In response, a research movement has emerged in order to
improve the strategic management
of sustainability-driven destinations and territories, and several
models have been proposed in this
perspective (L EADER , 1997, 1999;
Flagestad and Hope, 2001; Perret,
Teyssandier and Marette, 2001; Ritchie
and Crouch 2000, 2003). However,
the proposed methodologies are
not innocent. They generally stem
from unexplicit theories and, as
the French experiments have
demonstrated, it’s up to each territory to define its own method
depending on available competences and local characteristics
(Perret, Teyssandier and Baldié, 2006).

This paper’s purpose is to clarify
the theoretical basis of the study
in order to design a strategic analytical method for the destinations
under study. The method is a toolbox for leaders to (1) produce decision tools adapted to sustainable
development strategies; (2) put the
concept of sustainable tourism into
practice; and (3) identify the path
dependency of each destination.
First, this article builds a strategic diagnosis method that offers
a typology of strategic resources,
which are regrouped according to
three classifying criteria: (1) the
relevant pillar of sustainability;
(2) the created or inherited character of the resource; and (3) the
primary or secondary function of
the resource. Then, the strategic
diagnosis can be carried out by
reshuffling available data in a
matrix of the strengths and weaknesses of the destination.
Second, the method provides
destination leaders with strategic
management tools which give them
a useful framework to put the complex concept of sustainable tourism into practice. Thanks to the
cross-fertilisation of RBV and the
principles of sustainability, the
methodology fosters the implementation of sustainable tourism
projects and the mutation of tourism destinations into sustainable
development ventures. Depending
on their available resources, destination authorities can opt for
holistic sustainable approaches
(the cases of the Cinque Terre and
of the Frioul), or focus on one particular dimension (the Submed and
Vistoria programmes in TMA).
The method takes into account
the foreseeable effects of each decision from the strategy’s inception
phase. Decision makers can then
keep track of their resources at
any time T, and compare them

with the ongoing project, and the
actual achievements in T+1, T+2,
etc. Indeed, a long-term assessment of strategic options is vital
in a sustainable perspective and
batteries of indicators may be used
at this level.
Third, the methodology helps
identify the destination’s path
dependency in two ways: (1) by
distinguishing between inherited
and created resources; and (2) by
identifying culture as one of the
basic pillars of tourism sustainability. The methodology includes
the destination’s historical dimension in the analysis and, by doing
so, it discloses which of the past
choices influence the present strategic options. As the case studies
clearly show, once this information is taken into account, the site’s
evolutionary path may be modified thanks to a determined strategic policy and suitable governance practices.
In spite of its advances, this study
suffers from limitations and further research would be necessary
for a more thorough study of the
subject. First, on the methodological level, this exploratory research
resorts to several case studies in
order to capture the complexities
of an emerging phenomenon (Yin,
2003). The strategic diagnosis
methodology was built following
an iterative process that required
data collecting in different sites.
The three major cases are studied
in a longitudinal way and they
have many common characteristics. They are European– and
Mediterranean– based and are
managed by their communities
under the supervision of public
authorities. Nevertheless, each destination has unique features and
must resort to specific means to
achieve its proper sustainable objectives. Further investigations involJ U I N 2 0 1 0 • M O N D E S D U TO U R I S M E N ° 1

ving other destinations would be
necessary to achieve the statistical generalisation of the results.
In particular, studying the case of
resource-deprived areas would be
of interest. As it stands, the present framework is flexible enough
to accommodate a larger sample
of countries.
Second, on the theoretical level,
the method is still largely descriptive and the processes whereby a competitive advantage is
gained should be studied in greater depth. Now, the Cinque Terre
case reveals that the governance
system is a crucial success factor.
The governance issue is included
in the proposed model (support
to the business sector, destination’s
management), but the subject
requires further research. The
resource-based strategic diagnosis method proposed in this article
is just the starting point of further
research efforts to study the generative processes of competitive
advantages that observe the principles of sustainability.
