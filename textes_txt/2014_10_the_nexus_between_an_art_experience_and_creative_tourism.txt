Résumé. Le secteur culturel est, de plus en plus souvent, appréhendé par les gouvernements comme un vecteur de
croissance (touristique), notamment dans les sous-régions périphériques comme la Tasmanie où les industries dominantes
de jadis ont disparu. Ce secteur peut être une source de créativité locale, d'intégration sociale et d’attractivité touristique.
Dans certains cas, la création d'une entité culturelle iconique sert ce même but, avec un faible investissement public. C’est
le cas notamment du Museum of Old and New Art (MONA), musée entièrement privé situé dans l'État de Tasmanie
(Australie) qui a ouvert en 2011. Cet article analyse la relation entre le MONA (via son expérience de tourisme créatif) et
le gouvernement de Tasmanie. Une attention particulière est portée à la façon dont les différents acteurs utilisent le
concept d’expérience créative afin d’attirer des touristes aux différents événements et expositions. Le cas du MONA
montre que le concept de tourisme créatif est plus complexe que la seule prise en compte d’une approche “créative”. Il
montre, en outre, que l’utilisation d'expériences de tourisme créatif dans les stratégies de marque des destinations doit,
pour réussir, être partagée par l’ensemble des parties prenantes. Il ouvre ainsi la discussion sur les relations entre les
différentes parties prenantes dans le secteur du tourisme créatif.
Abstract. The cultural sector is increasingly seen as a potential driver of (tourism) growth by governments, especially in peripheral
sub-regions like Tasmania where the once dominant industries have departed. This sector can be a source of local creativity,
social inclusion and an attractor of tourists. Occasionally, the creation of an iconic cultural entity serves this purpose with minimal
input of public resources. Such a case is provided with the opening of the privately owned and operated Museum of Old and New
Art (MONA) in the state of Tasmania, Australia in 2011. This article analyses the relationship between MONA and its creative
tourism experience, and the government of Tasmania. A particular focus is thereby on how those actors use the concept of a
place-based creative art experience to attract tourists with events and exhibitions. In this respect, the MONA case shows that the
concept of creative tourism is far more complex than just taking a "creative" approach. Moreover, it argues that using creative
and cultural tourism experiences for place branding strategies will only be successful if the strategies are mutually agreed upon
amongst all stakeholders. In this sense, the article stipulates a discussion on stakeholder relations in the creative tourism sector.
