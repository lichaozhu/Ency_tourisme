    <sousTitre>To foster the mutation of tourism destinations into sustainable development ventures</sousTitre>
    <resume>
        This paper proposes a strategic diagnosis framework, derived from the resource-based view, in order to help tourism destinations mutate into sustainable development ventures. A resource-based approach points towards defining a tourism destination as a set of productive and human, tangible and intangible resources, which can generate sustained competitive advantages. In that respect, the first stage of a strategic diagnosis should be to identify and to classify a destination’s strategic resources. Thanks to the literature and to the observation of three European destinations located on the Mediterranean Sea, three criteria for a typology of resources are proposed: their sustainability dimension, their attractiveness for tourists and their inherited or created nature. The research produces a resource-based strategic diagnosis method that will help destination leaders identify the strategic assets and the path dependency of the destinations they manage. They can then define strategic options, improving both competitiveness and sustainability.

            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Since the mid-1990s, a growing number of tourism destinations have opted for sustainable development strategies in order to face the economic, social and environmental issues of tourism in their territories (Bensahel and Donsimoni, 1999; Ritchie and Crouch, 2000; Van der Yeught, 2008). These destinations aim at achieving a satisfactory balance between economic prosperity, social equity and the preservation of their natural heritage in order to ensure visitor satisfaction within an intensely competitive context. Once engaged, the sustainable development process requires a thorough analysis of the complexity of territories and of tourism phenomena, which calls for a renewal of existing analytical frameworks through the cross-fertilization with the different disciplines.</span>

            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">This paper adopts a strategic management perspective. Its starting point is that destinations, just like firms, strive to be competitive. Its purpose is to answer the following question: How can organisations that manage tourism destinations produce strategic diagnoses that include both competitiveness and sustainability constraints? A resource-based strategic approach leads to the identification of rare resources and core competencies because they may generate sustainable competitive advantages (SCA) (Barney, 1991). From this perspective, the paper intends to build a typology of strategic resources that can help destination leaders achieve their competitive and sustainable objectives.</span>

First, the paper examines the issues related to the sustainability and competitiveness of destinations and it suggests applying the resource-based view (RBV) framework to the question of sustainable destination management. Second, the methodological options are clarified and the three Mediterranean destinations under empirical study are presented: the Toulon Metropolitan Area (TMA)</span><a class="footnotecall" href="#ftn1" id="bodyftn1">1</a><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">, the Frioul Islands (both situated between the French Riviera and the Provence region), and the Cinque Terre National Park (on the Italian Riviera). Third, the enquiry identifies the criteria for a synthetic conceptual typology of sustainable strategic resources. Fourth, the following strategic diagnosis methodology is applied to the destinations under study to make sure it is supported by facts. The conclusion discusses the study’s results.</span>

        <paragraphe num="4">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">The origins of sustainable development (SD), as a popularly engaged construct, can be traced back to the </span><em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">World Commission on Environment and Development Report</span></em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"> (WCED, 1987), also known as </span><em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Brundtland Report</span></em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">, which defines SD as a type of development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The concept of SD was further popularised in 1992 thanks to the Rio Earth Summit, and to the Agenda 21 programme thereafter. This concept is both complex and multi-dimensional. It reaches beyond the contradiction summarised in the concept of eco-development (Sachs, 1980, 1997) by introducing a social dimension in the development issue. Basically, SD should aim at three main interconnected objectives (the three main ‘pillars’ of sustainability): robust economic growth, ecological viability and social equity. In accordance with the third objective, development should be concerned with issues of intragenerational equity (within a given generation, everyone should enjoy equitable access to resources and obtain their fair share of wealth) and intergenerational equity (for the benefit of future generations, the impacts of economic activities on natural capital should be controlled in order to ensure long-term economic growth and human survival itself). To address the social pillar of sustainability, Amartya Sen’s notion of ‘capabilities’ (Sen, 1991) and John Rawls’s ‘theory of justice’ (Rawls, 1987) could be of great interest in qualifying these activities that may lead to social sustainable development (Dubois et Mahieu, 2002; Rajaona Daka et Dubois, 2008).</span>

        <paragraphe num="5">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">The major applications of the concept of sustainability to the tourism industry date back to the 1990s and the first definitions of sustainable tourism were derived from the more general concept of SD. In 1995, the Charter for Sustainable Tourism of Lanzarote stipulated that ‘</span><em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">a requirement of sound management of tourism is that the sustainability of the resources on which it depends must be guaranteed’</span></em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">. It also advocated the </span><em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">‘global management of resources so as to ensure their viability’</span></em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">.</span>

        <paragraphe num="6">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">More recently, the World Tourism Organization (2004) formulated a fairly explicit conceptual definition which insists on (i) the optimal use of environmental resources; (ii) the respect of the socio-cultural authenticity of host communities; (iii) the necessity for tourism activities to ensure viable and long-term economic operations, providing for the participation of all the relevant stakeholders, as well as strong political leadership to ensure wide participation and consensus building; and (iv) the ability to maintain a high level of tourist satisfaction. This definition refers to ‘sociocultural authenticity’ without really identifying ‘culture’ as one of the pillars of sustainability. Yet, it may be useful to distinguish clearly between the ‘cultural’ and ‘social’ criteria of sustainability, if sustainable tourism is to be implemented.</span>

            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Although the growth rates in the tourism industry are still high and should remain so in the future (WTO, 1999), escalating competition among destinations leads many of them to seek to improve their competitiveness while trying to take into account the long-term effects of tourism activities in a sustainable perspective (Ritchie and Crouch, 2000).</span>

        <paragraphe num="8">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">The concept of competitiveness and the related concept of competitive advantage are central to strategic management. Although, these are complex and multifaceted concepts that cannot lead to universally accepted definitions (Crouch and Ritchie, 1999), they are generally defined as the ability of an organisation to generate higher performance than its competitors. From a strategic point of view, the competitive advantage is ‘sustained’ when the value-creating strategy that generates it cannot be imitated or duplicated by any current or potential competitor (Barney, 1991, p. 102).</span>

        <paragraphe num="9">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">A significant part of strategic management literature has sought to identify competitiveness factors depending on the micro or macro level of the analysis. Porter (1980) built the value chain model to analyse the roots of competitive advantage at the firm’s level and, to address competition at the national level, he proposed the diamond of competitive advantage (1990). Porter’s advances paved the way for scholars dealing with the competitiveness of tourism destinations. Thus, Flagestad and Hope (2001, p. 449) conceptualised a destination as a </span><em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">‘collection of inter-related economic activities’</span></em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">, then they proposed ‘the value fan’ model in which they distinguished between the primary and the support activities that compose a destination’s value chain. The primary activities are related to the creation of the destination’s tourism products and to the transfer of value to the visitors (</span><em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">via</span></em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"> hotels, restaurants, transport and other services), while the support activities contribute to the success of the primary activities, for example, by providing infrastructure, overall destination planning and the management of sustainability.</span>

            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Building on Porter’s diamond of national competitiveness (1990), Ritchie and Crouch (2000, 2003) developed a framework where they identified the basic sources of competitiveness and sustainability at the destination level. First, the authors made a distinction between comparative advantage, which results from a destination’s factor endowments, both natural and created, and competitive advantage, which lies in these strategic processes that allow tourism resources to be used efficiently. Then, the authors presented a model which is based on five components: (i) ‘supporting factors and resources’; (ii) ‘core resources and attractors’; (iii) ‘destination management’; (iv) ‘qualifying determinants’; and (v) ‘tourism policy’. Within this fifth component, they recommended an audit of the destination’s existing tourism resources and capabilities before making strategic decisions.</span>

Sets of indicators are also thought to be useful to assess destinations’ advances in terms of sustainable development (Perret, Teyssandier and Marette, 2001; Céron and Dubois, 2002; WTO, 2004). However, experiments carried out in France have shown that leaders tend to adapt existing approaches to local requirements. Examples include the method proposed by Perret, Teyssandier and Marette (2001), which has never been thoroughly applied, and the contradictory diagnoses and batteries of indicators which have never been put to use (Perret, Teyssandier and Baldié, 2006). As the literature review will show, the issues related to the strategic assessment of territories and destinations have already been built into different methodological constructions. However, how can we determine which listed criteria best apply to a given territory? Can these different approaches be combined into a single comprehensive and more manageable model without overlooking the destinations’ inherent complexities? To answer these questions, this paper intends to draw lessons from the RBV.</span>

        <paragraphe num="14">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Many definitions of tourism destinations have been proposed. Most of them focus on the territorial characteristics of the destination and on its capacity to attract and satisfy visitors. Flagestad and Hope (2001) referred to Penrose’s seminal work (1959) to define a destination as ‘a bundle of resources’, but they do not investigate further in this theoretical direction. Now, resources are central in a sustainable perspective and from a strategic point of view. Not only are they powerful attractive factors for the visitors, but they also influence the latter’s satisfaction while they experiment the tourism products. So, this paper is founded on the main advances of the RBV.</span>
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="15">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">In the resource-based perspective, a tourism destination can be conceptualised as a collection of productive and human, tangible and intangible resources that may lead to a sustained competitive advantage (Penrose, 1959; Barney, 1991). The capital of resources available in the destination at any given time results from the investments that were made in the past (Dierickx and Cool, 1989) because most of the attractive resources of a destination, such as the historical and cultural heritage, the natural environment, the landscapes, the reputation for quality and so forth, have required time and human effort to achieve their current state. These specific assets are the cumulative results of the community’s evolution over time and they play a crucial part in a destination’s success. So, in accordance with the evolutionary principle of path dependency, the strategic choices made in the past may constrain the destination’s evolution in the future (Dosi et al., 1990). In their attempt to explain why major companies’ diversification strategies are consistent with their history, Dosi et al. (1990) observed that ‘history matters’, which means that the specificity of an organisation’s assets influences its strategic evolution. However, the concept of path dependency does not foreclose future options because branching out remains a possibility through organisational learning and competitive pressure. The methodology of L</span><span lang="en" style="font-variant:small-caps;" xml:lang="en">eader</span><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"> programmes (1999) emphasised the strategic importance of the territories’ historical dimension because it reveals much about their identities, their present situations and their potential evolutions in the future.</span>
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="16">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">In the RBV, the resulting heterogeneity between destinations may lead to a sustained competitive advantage if the resource system is valuable (it exploits opportunities and/or neutralises threats from the business environment), rare, imperfectly imitable, and if there cannot be strategically equivalent substitutes for it (Barney, 1991). In this perspective, the purpose of strategic management consists in identifying, preserving, using and creating these resources which may generate competitive advantages, precisely because they are rare (Arrègle, 2006).</span>

Contrary to quantitative research strategies, the sampling of cases in qualitative research is not statistical, but analytical.

The authors of the support documents generally considered that these strategies were successful. They described the driving forces behind each project and they presented the results that had been obtained: the creation of new sustainable tourism activities, the improvement of the quality of tourism services, the rehabilitation of traditional settlements, the protection of the natural environment, the management of networks to implement sustainable tourism, etc. Some of these documents referred to difficulties in managing the networks. However, most of them rather focused on the general attainments than on specific quantitative results. Because this part of the study was based on a literature review, obtaining more accurate information proved difficult. As a remedy to these shortcomings, an in-depth analysis was carried out, between 2004 and 2010, on three Mediterranean destinations while they were implementing sustainable development strategies.</span>

TMA was created in January 2002 to meet the requirements of several French national devolution acts, which encourage the development of joint-venture partnerships between cities. Eleven municipalities in the Toulon area agreed to form the TMA cluster that extends from the Mediterranean seaboard to the Provence region. In January 2004, the new entity was still unfamiliar to the population and it needed financial funds to invest in local development policy. In this context, the strategy managers decided to join two European sustainable tourism programmes (Interreg III B and C): Submed, to promote sustainable scuba diving activities in the Mediterranean Sea, and Vistoria, to develop tourist itineraries highlighting scenic and historical resources. Within the Vistoria programme, TMA was in charge of designing methods to promote the historical and natural heritage of the nine European participating destinations. The investigation resulted in diagnosis tools that assess the strategic assets of the destination from a sustainable point of view.

            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">The Marseilles urban community is involved in an ambitious sustainable development strategy for all its seaboard areas. The programme includes the Frioul Islands where the local authorities intend to develop sustainable tourism projects. Given the small size of this archipelago (two hundred hectares), the Frioul Islands were selected as a laboratory case for this research experiment. Since 1971, the archipelago has been managed by the public authorities of the Marseilles Township after private investors failed to manage the site properly. One hundred people live full-time on the islands and they need to reach the continent in order to benefit from different kinds of amenities like schooling, medical services, employment, shopping, and so on. Although the tourists and local inhabitants are really fond of the place, tourism facilities are scarce. Most visitors access the archipelago on their private yachts and they sleep on board. The local authorities hope to make the Frioul Islands a show-case of Marseilles’ know-how regarding sustainability and, with that intent, they decided to organise a decision-forum where citizens, business managers, association leaders and public institution leaders were invited to express their views. This case study permitted the completion of the methodology of the pilot case’s strategic diagnosis, especially in its environmental and social dimensions. In the following stage of this survey, the tools of the strategic diagnosis have been tested and refined on the Cinque Terre National Park, which is one of the most advanced sustainable tourism ventures examined in this paper.</span>

This case is qualified as ‘exemplary’ because the destination’s leaders have reached ambitious sustainability objectives since the creation of the park in 1999, thanks to an original governance system. The CTNP is situated on the Ligurian sea-board, south of the port of Genova. This protected natural area was included in the U</span><span lang="en" style="font-variant:small-caps;" xml:lang="en">nesco</span><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"> environmental and cultural world heritage list in 1997. It qualified as a protected marine area in 1997 and as a national park in 1999. The cliffs fall vertically into the Ligurian Sea and the rocky coastline stands out as one of Italy’s most attractive landscapes. The scenery was modelled by men who, over a thousand years, painstakingly transformed the steep slopes into farming terraces and vineyards where the famous Sciachettrà wine is produced. Starting in the 1960s, modern roads encouraged young people to leave the five isolated villages to find jobs in the neighbouring cities and brought more tourists. However, as farming activities disappeared, the area’s terraced landscape quickly fell into decay, putting inhabitants and tourists at risk. The local authorities’ reaction was to develop a sustainable tourism strategy with the aim of creating jobs in order to encourage the inhabitants to remain in the villages and of controlling the impacts of tourism. Ten years after the creation of the protected area, the local authorities have already reached many of their initial objectives.

        <paragraphe num="27">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Experts generally identify the three pillars of sustainability as the economic, the social and the environmental pillars. However, the case studies have revealed that a fourth pillar, the cultural one, is of crucial importance to measure a territory’s path dependency, to define its identity and to determine its strategic position. Therefore, although the two dimensions are generally merged in the literature (WTO, 2004), the typology of resources proposed in this paper distinguishes between the social and cultural dimensions and specifies their different contents. The economic and environmental dimensions are the most widely quoted in the exploratory case studies. The economic pillar is illustrated through several activities, some of which are recurrent in the case studies: new profit-generating tourism products, quality labels for tourism businesses, job-inducing activities, additional income in poor areas, extension of the tourist season, creation of networks to implement sustainable tourism.</span>

        <paragraphe num="28">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">The environmental pillar is also central in most exploratory case studies, mainly in relation to the economic one. Environmental sustainability may assume different forms, such as new environment friendlier activities, eco-labels, environment management, waste reduction and energy-saving programmes, renewable energies, water management, the preservation of the natural heritage, environment-friendlier transport, human-powered mobility, the reduction of pollution and greenhouse gases, landscape conservation and soil erosion control.</span>

        <paragraphe num="29">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">As regards the social and cultural dimensions, official definitions do not clearly distinguish between the two (</span><em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">cf. supra</span></em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">). Yet, both notions appear to be sufficiently significant to justify separate approaches and specific clarifications. Culture refers to symbols. In the field of management science, Hofstede (2001, p. 1) defines culture as a </span><em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">‘collective programming of the mind’</span></em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">, which </span><em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">‘manifests itself not only in values, but in more superficial ways: in symbols, heroes, and rituals’</span></em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">. The mental programming processes of a given human group cannot be observed in daily life, but they can be captured through the artefacts produced by its members. Thus, in tourism destinations, cultural sustainability refers to different activities which aim at promoting the community’s artefacts and values. In the exploratory case studies, such activities may be: preserving the historical and architectural heritage, restoring traditional settlements, promoting the community’s arts and crafts, marketing local food and wine, and creating special events and entertainments. These cultural assets contribute to a destination’s competitiveness and sustainability, because they make it more attractive and unique when compared to rival destinations.</span>

            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">As far as the social pillar is concerned, we may resort to three concepts developed by Amartya Sen and John Rawls in their attempt to improve social justice: accessibility and capability enhancement (Sen, 1991), and equity (Rawls, 1987). In our framework, these concepts may be applied to various target groups: the tourists, the local communities, and the employees and the managers of tourism companies. The accessibility criterion is derived from Sen (1991), who frequently identifies free movement (and safety and security as its prerequisites) as one of the basic human rights. Now, because many people are deprived of tourism consumption by health or financial problems, the accessibility criterion has been selected to account for destinations’ efforts to respect their visitors’ rights to unrestricted access, especially when vulnerable visitors are concerned. For the disabled, access can be made easier thanks to appropriate infrastructure and services. For instance, the CTNP has designed specific activities for handicapped visitors. For financially-challenged persons, cheap accommodation may facilitate access to tourism destinations. For example, the only referenced accommodation provider in the Frioul archipelago (except rentals) is a non-profit association which rents dorms to visiting groups.</span>

Indeed, it helps answer the compelling dilemma faced by all social organisations: individuals have to cooperate to maximise their mutual interests and the fruits of their common productive efforts have to be shared fairly. Consequently, the issue of distributive justice proves to be particularly crucial in the tourism industry. For example, in the Cinque Terre case, profits from tourism generated through the park’s turnover pay for ‘Quality of Life’ initiatives. </span>

            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">The second criterion used to classify strategic resources aims at identifying the destinations’ path dependencies in order to determine future strategic options consistent with their history. This criterion was developed during the Vistoria project (pilot case) with the help of several historians. Their mission was to design a common methodology to promote the natural and historical resources of the partner destinations. The approach they suggested was to list and to date the area’s different cultural resources and to explain how the landscapes had changed in history. Tourist discovery routes were developed from these data with two objectives: first, they were to publicise the community’s identity by promoting its cultural artefacts and its ‘uniqueness’; second, the routes’ visitors could enjoy new experiences by discovering the destination’s authentic heritage. The purpose of the second classification criterion, drawn from the Vistoria historians’ approach, is to capture the evolutionary processes that have generated the destination.</span>

            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">To understand what Penrose (1959) called ‘the direction of expansion’, it is vital to measure at any given time the stock of the ‘inherited resources’ that are transmitted by past generations. Now, the mix of the resources which are available at any given time within a destination results from flows and stocks dynamics (Dierickx and Cool, 1989) that require the development of new resources and strategies. So, the second classification criterion separates ‘inherited resources’ from ‘created ones’, as suggested by Ritchie and Crouch (2003, p. 23). Inherited resources may be defined as the natural and historical material passed on to the living generations by the path dependency process. These inherited resources fit precisely into the ‘resource endowments’ category as defined by Ritchie and Crouch (2000, 2003). They include both natural resources, such as weather characteristics, geography, hydrography, wildlife and flora, etc., and resources crafted by past generations such as old industrial plants, historically-significant businesses, local traditions, typical architecture, historical and cultural attractions, etc.</span>
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="39">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">On the other hand, created resources result from the ongoing activities of present generations and they widely depend on their competences. In our framework, created resources incorporate competences into a set of elementary resources so as to develop sustainable tourism. For example, wildlife and flora are classified as environmental inherited resources whereas protected areas and zoos fall into the created resources category since they resort to scientific know-how to manage, at the present time, the destination’s natural heritage. Similarly, the destination’s old industrial plants and historically-significant businesses (for example vintage hotels, historical cafés) are classified as economic inherited resources because they are not competitive tourist activities as such. To qualify as created resources, they need to be combined with human knowledge, capital resources and tourism competences to contribute to the destination’s competitiveness (Ritchie and Crouch, 2003). Admittedly, certain cases of hybridisation may occasionally occur and blur the distinction between the two resource categories. However, because developing resources and competences is a dynamic process, resource hybridisation is generally temporary and does not justify giving up the distinction altogether. This distinction introduces a dynamic element in the basically static classification system. It clearly brings out the path dependency of the destination, and helps define new strategic options which are consistent with past choices.</span>

        <paragraphe num="40">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">The third classification criterion is derived from Porterian terminology. It helps distinguish between ‘primary’ and ‘support’ resources. As seen in the literature review, in order to analyse the roots of competitive advantage at the firm’s level, Porter (1980) built the value chain model where he distinguished between the primary and support activities and Flagestad and Hope (2001) used the Porterian distinction to conceptualise a destination’s value chain (the value fan model). This paper suggests applying the Porterian terminology not simply to economic activities but also to environmental, social and cultural resources. In our construction, the primary resources characterise the major assets of a destination as a tourist attraction. These assets create value for visitors either as unique attractions or combined with others. On the other hand, support resources relay and complement the attractive power of the primary resources. They often play a vital role in the production of sustainable value without being attractive themselves. From that perspective, tourist accommodation and entertainment facilities are classified as ‘economic created primary resources’, while ancillary collective services, which are used by tourists but are not part of the tourism industry (public transport, banking services, medical care) fall into the ‘economic support resources’ category. These support resources only create value for visitors when combined with primary resources.</span>

These two poles enjoy rich cultural and natural assets (on land and sea). They also benefit from the scientific expertise acquired in oceanographic fields of study by the National Park of Port-Cros (the first French sea park opened in 1963) and by the Institut océanographique Paul Ricard (established in 1966). However, tourism facilities are unevenly distributed and generally substandard (mostly open air camping sites).

The study shows that Toulon’s difficulties in developing as a seaside resort date back to the 17th century, when Colbert decided to turn the town into France’s premier naval base while Marseilles was to specialise in commercial shipping. This political decision is at the beginning of a path dependency that still has far-reaching effects on the current developing prospects of the two main French Mediterranean sea ports. At present, the French Navy is relinquishing a growing number of its properties in the Toulon Bay Area and the civilian authorities are taking over many fortified strongholds from the military. These forts (there are about thirty of them) add fresh value to the destination’s cultural heritage. Since its inception in 2002, TMA has invested heavily in order to restore them one by one and has included them into visitors’ sightseeing programmes. This has come as a preliminary step to the Vistoria programme, which aims at channelling evenly the flows of visitors over the territory’s area thanks to new tourism theme routes.</span>

In 2010, Submed’s success and fame among tourism operators encouraged TMA to propose expertise transfers to other countries as an international cooperation scheme. A Submed 2 application file is currently being processed by the French and European authorities.

However, any potential development venture may affect the environment and faces strong opposition. On the social level, the Marseilles municipality encouraged many non profit associations to develop youth educational programmes and work reinsertion initiatives for deprived persons. On the environmental level, the site has benefited from a preservation scheme managed by the CEEP, a conservatory devoted to the study of the Provence area ecosystems, which has carried out several surveys of the archipelago’s wildlife and flora. On the cultural level, several work insertion programmes help restoring the site’s historical heritage, notably the Lazaret and the Caroline hospital which used to be Marseilles’ quarantine confinement stations.

            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">In recent years, as tourism was developing globally, a significant number of destination leaders have been increasingly concerned about competitiveness and sustainability issues. They have seen them both as necessary to implement the inevitable mutation towards sustainability. In response, a research movement has emerged in order to improve the strategic management of sustainability-driven destinations and territories, and several models have been proposed in this perspective (L</span><span lang="en" style="font-variant:small-caps;" xml:lang="en">eader</span><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">, 1997, 1999; Flagestad and Hope, 2001; Perret, Teyssandier and Marette, 2001; Ritchie and Crouch 2000, 2003). However, the proposed methodologies are not innocent. They generally stem from unexplicit theories and, as the French experiments have demonstrated, it’s up to each territory to define its own method depending on available competences and local characteristics (Perret, Teyssandier and Baldié, 2006). This paper’s purpose is to clarify the theoretical basis of the study in order to design a strategic analytical method for the destinations under study. The method is a toolbox for leaders to (1) produce decision tools adapted to sustainable development strategies; (2) put the concept of sustainable tourism into practice; and (3) identify the path dependency of each destination.</span>

Then, the strategic diagnosis can be carried out by reshuffling available data in a matrix of the strengths and weaknesses of the destination.</span>

Thanks to the cross-fertilisation of RBV and the principles of sustainability, the methodology fosters the implementation of sustainable tourism projects and the mutation of tourism destinations into sustainable development ventures. Depending on their available resources, destination authorities can opt for holistic sustainable approaches (the cases of the Cinque Terre and of the Frioul), or focus on one particular dimension (the Submed and Vistoria programmes in TMA). The method takes into account the foreseeable effects of each decision from the strategy’s inception phase. Decision makers can then keep track of their resources at any time T, and compare them with the ongoing project, and the actual achievements in T+1, T+2, etc. Indeed, a long-term assessment of strategic options is vital in a sustainable perspective and batteries of indicators may be used at this level.</span>

The methodology includes the destination’s historical dimension in the analysis and, by doing so, it discloses which of the past choices influence the present strategic options. As the case studies clearly show, once this information is taken into account, the site’s evolutionary path may be modified thanks to a determined strategic policy and suitable governance practices.</span>

First, on the methodological level, this exploratory research resorts to several case studies in order to capture the complexities of an emerging phenomenon (Yin, 2003). The strategic diagnosis methodology was built following an iterative process that required data collecting in different sites. The three major cases are studied in a longitudinal way and they have many common characteristics. They are European – and Mediterranean – based and managed by their communities under the supervision of public authorities. Nevertheless, each destination has unique features and must resort to specific means to achieve its proper sustainable objectives. Further investigations involving other destinations would be necessary to achieve the statistical generalisation of the results. In particular, studying the case of resource-deprived areas would be of interest. As it stands, the present framework is flexible enough to accommodate a larger sample of countries.</span>

            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Second, on the theoretical level, the method is still largely descriptive and the processes whereby a competitive advantage is gained should be studied in greater depth. Now, the Cinque Terre case reveals that the governance system is a crucial success factor. The governance issue is included in the proposed model (support to the business sector, destination’s management), but the subject requires further research. The resource-based strategic diagnosis method proposed in this article is just the starting point of further research efforts to study the generative processes of competitive advantages that observe the principles of sustainability. </span>
