    <titre>Tourism Implementation, an Issue of Territoriality: National Approach and Local Action Methods and Resources</titre>
    <sousTitre>Study of the Colombian Municipalities of La Mesa (Cundinamarca) and Villavieja (Huila)</sousTitre>
    <resume>
        This article analyses the tourism implementation process in two Colombian municipalities, La Mesa (Cundinamarca) and Villavieja (Huila), based on a two-tier observation at national and local levels. First, we review how territorial public action is implemented to develop tourism (Négrier 2007; Duran 2011) at a national level by the most important stakeholder involved, the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism (MINCIT). This involves examining how this government body intervenes in sub-national authorities, based on the decentralisation and planning policy for tourist activity. At a local level, we address the specific dynamics in both municipalities and the progress they have made in implementing the national tourism policy. This two-tier observation reveals tensions between the national facilitators’ view on what needs to be done and local facilitators’ view on what can be done. We highlight the major local challenges this activity involves, in terms of administration and management in the municipalities, and also considerations linked to the construction of territoriality (Sack 1986; Raffestin 1982) and territory, which are crucial for the process in question.

            Based on this perspective, this paper considers the implementation of this process in the Colombian municipalities of Villavieja (Huila Department) and La Mesa (Cundinamarca Department) with a two-tier observation that examines the State’s intervention, approach and structure at a local level. 
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="5">
            Theoretically, this intervention forms part of the territorialisation of public action (Négrier 2007; Duran 2011), which transfers considerations on social group interaction (facilitators), the power to plan tourism and the space where that action is to take place. The crux of creating tourism sites involves dimensions related to the State exercising power over the territory and constructing territoriality through institutional facilitators that highlight new land uses, and plan and manage the land for new economic activities.

            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Territoriality involves stakeholders seeking to affect or influence (Sack 1986, pp. 19–22), and it is also a “</span><em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">relationship</span></em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"> </span><em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">system that a community—and therefore an individual belonging to it—has with exteriority and/or alterity aided by facilitators”</span></em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"> (Raffestin 1982, p. 170).</span><a class="footnotecall" href="#ftn3" id="bodyftn3">3</a><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"> For the study of tourism implementation, this involves considering social practices in the space, the </span><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">relationships society establishes with the territory, and changes in the territory resulting from the social objectives the facilitators pursue. The latter can be political or economic leaders (Raffestin 2012, p. 60), or residents in the local area.

For this reason, a two-tier observational analysis is proposed, working on the principle that exercising power for tourism implementation is explicit in institutional architecture. Ministerial bodies intervene in areas and territories due to a process emanating from the State’s management power, which seeks to organise facilitators and geographical spaces through decentralisation and creates interactions between local and national and public and private stakeholders and officials.</span><a class="footnotecall" href="#ftn4" id="bodyftn4">4</a><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"> </span>

        <paragraphe num="8">
            On assessing the proposed municipalities, we find that the natural conditions in Villavieja are favourable towards encouraging tourism due to Tatacoa Desert (Figure 1). 
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="9">
            Covering an area of 330 km, this is a dry tropical and very dry tropical forest (temperature of 35 °C) containing Colombia’s best palaeontological assets, such as fossils of large mammals, and there is potential for geological studies. As the desert is an exceptional place for stargazing, it has been promoted for international tourism (Figure 2) and become an economic priority in a municipality whose incidence of poverty reached 44.3% of the population in 2015.
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="10">
            La Mesa, just 65 km from Bogota, has tourism features focusing on cultural and ecological perspectives (Cundinamarca Tourism Development Plan 2012), and a pleasant climate (22–28 °C). The inventory of its tourism sites includes natural landscapes and tangible cultural resources such as five royal roads, railway stations and vista points (Parra 2008) (Figure 3).
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="11">
            La Masa is both a city, which, according to its motto, is friendly and welcoming, and a municipality with 30,000 inhabitants, 34 rural settlements and three police jurisdictions (La Esperanza, San Joaquín and San Javier). 
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="12">
            This study required an information collation exercise that began with a compilation of rules governing tourism in Colombia and forming the legal framework for local administrative bodies. Reports, evaluations, plans, assessments and information bulletins issued by public bodies were also collated through direct requests or taken from the platforms of the institutions concerned, so that we could understand their form of management, institutional planning practices and the status of the implementation process at a local level. 
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="13">
            Fieldwork consisted of touring and visiting locations and sites with an influx of tourists (royal roads, ravines, Tatacoa Desert and its surrounding area and two former train stations) in the municipalities of La Mesa and Villavieja in July 2017, with the stays in both places lasting one week, and then a return to La Mesa in December 2017 lasting three days. 
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="14">
            The two-tier observation perspective thus involved interviews with national and local officials. Firstly, with civil servants from the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism (MINCIT) and the Tourism Promotion Fund (FONTUR) and then with their local counterparts, i.e., public officials responsible for implementing or complying with the rules and management proposed at a national level. In both cases the interviews were semi-open, taking place face-to-face or by telephone. Electronic messaging was also used, and responses to questionnaires were obtained in the same way, when the officials chose this disclosure mechanism.

            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">The local stakeholders we interviewed were selected on the basis of their role in the development and promotion of tourism in the municipalities of La Mesa and Villavieja. For example, officials responsible for the tourism implementation process and its economic promotion. As local progress is in its infancy, as evidenced by the scarcity of staff working on the subject, the absence of an office devoted exclusively to tourism management and dissemination when the fieldwork took place, and virtual lack of any qualitative and quantitative information on conditions in the territory for establishing tourism-related activities, we also had to use indirect sources through interviews held during the tours or outside the observation area to provide us with more knowledge of the study subject. At a local level, private stakeholders were also interviewed. They were selected based on their interest in implementing this activity (theme park managers, motorcycle taxi drivers, informal guides in Villavieja and shopkeepers). Two in-depth interviews were held with an expert in drafting tourism projects for the municipalities of the Crensa Foundation</span><a class="footnotecall" href="#ftn5" id="bodyftn5">5</a><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"> in August 2017.</span>

            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">In Colombia, tourism policies began in 1931, when Law 48 establishing the Official Tourism Service came into effect to “</span><em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">configure a national tourist geography that is promoted abroad” </span></em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">(Bolívar et al. 2001, p. 72), linked to the promotion of sites and national events, such as the National Beauty Contest of Cartagena (ibid., p. 74). When the Colombian Tourism Company was founded in 1957, public action centred on prioritised investment in places such as the Atlantic Coast, which has become a traditional destination for Colombian tourism, and external promotion mainly in Venezuela. The National Tourism Corporation was created a decade later, focusing on selling tourism infrastructure to private industry and prioritising the domestic market (ibid.). </span>

        <paragraphe num="17">
            Our study of the abovementioned municipalities focuses on government management from a national decentralisation perspective, as this is essential for understanding how the new wave of tourism implementation is currently faring in Colombia since the State bases its organisation, management and territorialisation of this activity on this approach.

Marcou (2008), cited by De la Torre (2017, p. 98), highlights that Colombia’s decentralisation objectives were political and economic as they focused on giving the State more prominence at local and regional levels, since their stakeholders’ presence was sometimes “</span><em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">exclusive and arbitrary”,</span></em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"> as pointed out by Leal and Dávila (1991), cited in De la Torre (ibid.). </span>

        <paragraphe num="20">
            This process, implemented in a first stage with steps as important as establishing local authority elections by universal suffrage and allocating resources from a central to a local level, has been transformed since the end of 1998. The enactment of Law 489/1998 on local authority and national development plan organisation between 2000 and 2010, combined with the General System of Economic Participation for Departments, Districts and Municipalities in the Nation’s current revenue (Legislative Act 01/2001), led to a return to the past since the State sought to re-centralise management, administration and planning of the local public sector (De la Torre 2017, p. 99). As far as the study subject is concerned, this shift specifically meant that an examination of the territory and its organisation should primarily be based on the belief that territorial planning suffices to achieve the required objectives at a local level.
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="21">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">That is why territorial planning became obligatory (Legislative Act 03/2011) through regional and municipal plans (art. 339), and Department Assemblies were obliged, through Ordinances, to issue provisions related to planning, economic and social development, and financial and credit support for municipalities, including for tourism (art. 300). Decentralisation immediately became a way of managing the country’s sector resources: “</span><em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">health, education and drinking water ... but which made it the Nation’s useful instrument for performing the most urgent tasks, irrespective of whether it was consistent or fitted with regional priorities”</span></em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"> (Barberena 2010, p. 58).</span>
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="22">
            Territorial tourism planning was specified by the General Tourism Law 300/1996. This regulation established the sector’s economic importance and the need to anticipate its expansion in a specific plan as part of the national development plan (produced by the DNP, the National Planning Department), which every municipality had to produce, targeting competitiveness (Toro 2003), and agreements between national and regional authorities through tourism competitiveness agreements (year 2000) for products and destinations (Fernández 2003). Public action at a national level has adopted a sectoral and hierarchical approach to management, governed by the MINCIT, which identifies potential stakeholders in tourism development and results in interactions between facilitators. 
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="23">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">The MINCIT’s work as a facilitator is essential (drafting, managing, coordinating and evaluating economic and social development policy, managing investment funds for the sector, through FONTUR, the Tourism Promotion Fund) since it finally decided to create tourism sites using a variety of mechanisms following overall guidelines, objectives and policies in the government’s national plan. By way of example, President Juan Manuel Santos’ plan (2014–2018)</span><a class="footnotecall" href="#ftn8" id="bodyftn8">8</a><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"> addressed public devices and the Ministry’s central role. Its </span><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">position as a provider of services</span><a class="footnotecall" href="#ftn9" id="bodyftn9">9</a><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"> for the public and private sector involves intervening directly in improving the quality of tourism sites and existing products, the large-scale creation of tourist regions, for example the “Tourism Corridors of Magical Realism” programme, and starlight destinations. The latter involves international certification obtained after complying with the environmental and infrastructure conditions of the territory in question to attract more international tourism, which is the aim with Tatacoa Desert. </span>
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="24">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">The intermediate facilitators’ role in the hierarchy of power—here the governments of the Departments of Cundinamarca and Huila—is as administrators and coordinators of the matter and of MINCIT programmes. These two facilitators interact on the basis of the State’s view of decentralisation in Colombia, which, in this case, turns the national entity into a provider of services to municipalities across several issues (advice for producing the local tourism plan, link to investment projects and training),</span><a class="footnotecall" href="#ftn10" id="bodyftn10">10</a><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"> highlighted as free,</span><a class="footnotecall" href="#ftn11" id="bodyftn11">11</a><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"> in accordance with their guidelines. The municipalities’ autonomous stance lies at the heart of local action, since they are expected to make direct requests on their own initiative to produce their local tourism plan—the local link to specific national programmes or projects. This coincides with the fact that the autonomy dimension is deemed synonymous with decentralisation in local authorities in Colombia (De la Torre 2017, p. 99). </span>
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="25">
            These elements obviously provide municipalities with new public action frameworks and also create functional reference systems both public and private facilitators can use at a local level and they interlink when tourism is established at new sites such as La Mesa, Cundinamarca, or improved at others, such as Tatacoa Desert.
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="26">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">National facilitators have introduced a new level of local management that revolves around producing local municipal plans required by Law (152/1994) and based on National Tourism Plan guidelines. They require considerable technical expertise, as demonstrated in the Technical Assistance Manual</span><a class="footnotecall" href="#ftn12" id="bodyftn12">12</a><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"> in use during the last three national governments. Figure 4 provides a summarised sample of the specific requirements to be met to draft these documents.

        <paragraphe num="27">
            Consequently, national facilitators establish what is required to transform spaces into tourism sites and territories or to spark local actions along these lines. This reveals denotative issues (Raffestin 2012, p. 58), such as coherence between the State’s liberal stance, the competitiveness and sustainability of tourist destinations and products, and the future profitability of projects to be financed. Now we need to examine the formats and dynamics that this desire for proactive tourism planning produces on a local scale.

        <paragraphe num="28">
            To understand the progress and challenges of the tourism implementation initiative at a local level, we need to examine the local dynamics this process involves for municipalities in a decentralised framework. Firstly, local officials have direct responsibilities in the tourism implementation process, not only because they have the mandate to ensure national plans are fulfilled in municipalities, but also because they have territorial powers (for example, they can decide how land is used in accordance with the Political Constitution, art. 313) directly involved in producing territories designed for this activity.

        <paragraphe num="29">
            One of the observation elements of the tourism implementation process in Colombia based on the territorial planning MINCIT requests from municipalities is how this plan is drawn up. It is based on mayors elected by popular vote, who are required by legislation stemming from the National and Department Plan to include a tourism development plan in their government plan, not always having expert personnel, institutional arrangements or at least internal management for this task. Local planning is, therefore, governed by the department’s guidelines for that area and reproduces them in local plans.

            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Given officials’ shortcomings, advisers external to the municipality or expert organisations (e.g. NGOs) may be hired to draft the sector plan.</span><a class="footnotecall" href="#ftn13" id="bodyftn13">13</a><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"> Although there is a Secretariat for Economic and Tourism Development in the municipality, with the same hierarchical level as other Secretariats (Infrastructure, Health and Treasury), its officials have to perform multiple tasks and deal with other issues. Similarly, some actions of the Development Plan of </span><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Cundinamarca Department may be implemented along general lines without any local planning (Municipality of La Mesa 2012).

        <paragraphe num="31">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">The planning process is also fraught with management difficulties, since collating basic information on the governed territory and feasible sites for tourist creation requires personnel that are not available. At department level, they have produced inventories of tourist attractions and 11 main lines of action for the 2010–2020 horizon (Government of Cundinamarca, 2012). A field information survey was conducted for the first time in 2017. It outlined a first assessment of some specific resources that could become tourist attractions and detailed their state of deterioration,</span><a class="footnotecall" href="#ftn14" id="bodyftn14">14</a><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"> making it clear, as Viveros and Sabina (2016) stated, that there is significant demand for local investment to restore historic sites, and for community and ecological tourism, in a situation where financial solvency is low.</span><a class="footnotecall" href="#ftn15" id="bodyftn15">15</a>

            For this purpose, the decentralised framework provides the resources of FONTUR, <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">which is a MINCIT body responsible for collecting, managing and providing finance for tourism, to alleviate any municipal financial deficiencies. </span>These funds can be obtained by submitting projects following the tourism promotion, marketing, competitiveness and infrastructure guidelines in the abovementioned technical manual.<a class="footnotecall" href="#ftn16" id="bodyftn16">16</a> However, <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">La Mesa’s difficulties can be summed up by the municipality’s absence from the Ministry’s initiative with the most national impact, the “Tourism Corridors of Magical Realism”, whose major investments</span><a class="footnotecall" href="#ftn17" id="bodyftn17">17</a><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"> can only be accessed by submitting regional or local proposals.

Although there are no official figures, the increase in creating tourism sites has revolved around leisure activities (adventure, culture, bird watching, sports and corporate events) taking the format of theme parks (Makute, Macadamia) or nature tour companies (Wuaira), or various types of accommodation (41 hotels, estates and lodgings).</span><a class="footnotecall" href="#ftn19" id="bodyftn19">19</a><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"> These entrepreneurs have begun to organise themselves into associations, such as the Tequendama Tourism Association (Corturistec), to consolidate actions and open up to the international market. Although the stakeholders agree in recognising that the territory has value due to its rural and landscape heritage, responding to demand to establish the sector requires public and private facilitators, officials and stakeholders to interact with each other based on regulatory frameworks existing since 2012 (Law 1558/2012, art. 9). However, these interaction processes are far-reaching and only began to be implemented in this municipality at the end of 2017.</span>

            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">MINCIT’s territorial public action comprises local autonomisation by proposing technological training or participation in work groups that this Ministry coordinates from Bogota, supported by training agencies such as the National Learning Service (Sena), department government, the Chamber of Commerce of Girardot and others. At a local level, however, territorial repossession of potential tourism sites is a priority, since rail tracks, their stations, and the networks of royal roads dating from colonial times are being lost as victims of illegal seizure, authorised use, or simply a lack of maintenance</span><a class="footnotecall" href="#ftn20" id="bodyftn20">20</a><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"> (Figures 5 and 6). </span>

            In the past, royal roads were undoubtedly essential public thoroughfares for regional communication. Mules and muleteers, load bearers, merchants and inhabitants from all over the region used to travel along them with agricultural produce to access population centres where food was stockpiled, such as La Mesa, or reach train stations such as San Javier, Anolaima and Cachipay. These places were essential junctions given that the railroad covered 132 km, linking Bogota with Girardot. The latter is the port city on Magdalena River, which has linked the interior of the country with the commercial seaports of Cartagena, Santa Marta and Barranquilla, on the Caribbean Sea, since colonial times.

            Today, they have potential for tourism development due to their historic assets, for example, three royal roads (Alto del Tigre, San Javier and Palmar) in the rural area of La Mesa, and one of the sites of most ecotourism interest, the Salto de las Monjas waterfall. However, these spaces are gradually disappearing and deteriorating since they are falling victim to private land seizure practices and, in some cases, sections are abandoned or becoming waste areas. 
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="37">
            The first practices mentioned include owners of farms adjacent to the roads erecting fences, the invasion of sections, construction of houses on old routes or absorbing nature and the loss of the alignment due to a lack of maintenance. Several sections have become waste disposal sites for domestic or construction waste, as well as places to dump domestic and agricultural wastewater (resulting from pig farming, for example) where drain pipes can be seen protruding from the boundaries of the farms adjacent to the old roads. In some places, wastewater settles onto these roads.

            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Understanding the specific aspects of the tourism implementation process in this municipality first requires us to consider the legal status of the area encompassing Tatacoa Desert. In 2008 (Figure 7), this territory was defined as a Regional District with Integrated Management (Regional District with Integrated Management 2015, p. 67), which in regulations means that it is a “</span><em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">geographical space where landscapes and ecosystems maintain their composition and function, even when their structure has been modified and whose associated natural and cultural values are made available to the human population for sustainable use, preservation, restoration, knowledge and enjoyment”</span></em><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">. </span>

The CAM study reports that they mainly settled on small properties throughout the area and until 2016 there were 303 families in the DRMI of La Tatacoa (1,060 people). Attempts to implement the pillars of sustainable tourism (environmental, economic, social and cultural) can be thwarted by social deposits, resulting from public and private land management practices that make it hard to comply with national </span><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">and local plans and projects.

        <paragraphe num="46">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">The creation of tourism sites is closely linked to territorial public action, which in this case begins with the MINCIT, the national institution at the heart of the process since it manages the issue based on a decentralisation and development planning perspective that conveys national policies to municipal bodies. When creating tourism sites (Raffestin 2012, p. 59), local authorities should be autonomous managers that plan and coordinate public and private stakeholders and provide funding for tourism projects. </span>
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="47">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">However, the municipalities studied face situations that make it hard for them to produce and implement national plans due to bureaucratic and financial shortcomings in a framework in which the possibilities of tapping into public resources depend on municipal management and obtaining resources with no specific allocation (own and transfers from the central level). Above all, central planning requirements turn into a normative obligation. Their local relevance lies in making people aware of “what needs to be done” to establish tourism, even if small municipal administrations find the guidelines hard to follow. </span>
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="48">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">From an area perspective, we agree with Raffestin (2012, p. 58), insofar as tourism implementation is a long-term process since it depends on the territory’s natural conditions and on the relationship that the social groups concerned establish among themselves and with the space they relate to. This poses a challenge for the municipalities we studied because they need to build a new territoriality that enables repossession of publicly owned spaces and areas currently used by private stakeholders. The overlapping deposits of the relationships that the State, at a national level, and the authorities, at a local level, have placed on the territory, influence the construction of a renewed and sustainable territory for a new wave of exploitation. </span>
