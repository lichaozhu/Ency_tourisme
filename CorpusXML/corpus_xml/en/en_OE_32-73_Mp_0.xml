    <titre>Mykonos: a place of experimentation for the gastronomy-world relationship</titre>
    <resume>
        The purchase of souvenirs is one of the activities realized by visitors as part of the tourist experience at a given destination. Among the many kinds of souvenirs offered around the world, food and beverages stand out for being goods charged with meanings linked to the geographic and touristic space, bearing attributes capable of generating sensations and extending the experience of the trip. Furthermore, as presents, they give to those who receive them a part of the lived experience, what we call a “gastronomic souvenir.” A wide range of products can be considered gastronomic souvenirs ; yet there are five variables that are fundamental for grasping the concept : foods and beverages ; identification ; packaging ; identity ; and transportability. From this presupposition, this study aimed to identify and analyze the commercialization of gastronomic souvenirs of Curitiba, an urban tourist destination located in the southern region of Brazil. Empirical and exploratory in nature, the case study began with a bibliographic review followed by field work aiming to identify the foods and beverages sold in establishments marketing souvenirs, data being collected from a spatial sample delineated by the circuit of the Linha Turismo (Tourist Line), a tourism bus service in the city. As a result, we found that the offer of gastronomic souvenirs in Curitiba is varied, though cookies, chocolates, wines and cane alcohol (cachaça) stand out, as these are tied to the cultural identity of Curitiba and the region in which the city is inserted.

            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Since Antiquity, the inhabitants of the island of Mykonos have worshipped Dionysus, the god of wine and pleasure. This Dionysian devotion may possibly explain the publicly claimed taste for celebration which is the cornerstone of the island’s modern identity. Born in Thebes, Dionysus was an errant, wandering God. Considered to play the role of an outsider due to his surprising Oriental attire, he was “a God from nowhere and everywhere” (Vernant, 1999, p. 171). Jean-Pierre Vernant explains Dionysus’ unique characterisation in the following way : “He represents (…) the role of the other, that which is different, confusing, disconcerting, anomic” (Vernant, 1999, p. 172). This Dionysian otherness sheds a mystic light on what can be analysed as the island’s “tourist” vocation, inherited from ancient times and considered today as a kind of destiny. Indeed, as Jean-Pierre Vernant specifies, “stories about him take on a particular meaning when we think about the tension between roaming, wandering, always travelling, and the desire to find a home, our own well-defined place where we are not merely accepted, but chosen” (Vernant, 1999, p. 172). As a modern Dionysus, the tourist has become a “central” actor in festivities, spatial development and the very future of Mykonos.</span>

        <paragraphe num="2">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">A noteworthy place where inhabitants meet and are confronted with tourists (temporary inhabitants), Mykonos appears as an island whose fame and tourist attractivity are based on its festivities, wine (particularly champagne, or more broadly, alcohol) and the fruits of the earth. It is a “gastronomic” island, with the understanding that gastronomy means the collection of rules, discourses and fantasies linked to good drinking and good eating that tourists can take part in. Since Antiquity, yet still more today, gastronomy is a revealing factor and a strong indicator of globalisation. Within this context, tourism may be understood to be a mediator as the tourist does not merely consider nourishment to be a physiological necessity, but from time to time a major component, or even a goal, of the tourist experience, by seeking to discover an Elsewhere and an Other via taste. It thus seems relevant to focus on the relationship between gastronomy and the world through the perspective of a tourist destination : Mykonos. How is Mykonos the perfect place of experimentation for studying this relationship, and how does it constitute a small-scale version of the whole world’s table that is attractive to tourists ?</span>
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="3">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">The choice of Mykonos can be justified in three ways. First, its geographical position in the Cyclades has been criss-crossed by tensions, alternatively opening it to and closing it off from the world, both in terms of eating/cooking and gastronomic principles on a global scale, and via worldwide (non-voluntary) work and tourist (by choice) migration patterns. Secondly, Mykonos is located in the historical and geographical centre of a civilising eating model based on wheat, olives and wine. As such, the inscription of the Mediterranean diet on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity on 16 November 2010 has reignited the question of both Mykonos/world mimicry (mimêsis) and the representative aspects of its eating/cooking and gastronomic system (in the food service industry) at a worldwide scale. Thirdly, the advanced touristification of Mykonos since the 1960s and 1970s has made it an undeniable international tourist destination, and an “entertaining” place for tourism : the island welcomes approximately 400,000 tourists per year, and nearly 90 % of jobs are directly or indirectly linked to tourism. The considerable stakes surrounding dining begin to reveal their importance in the summer travel patterns of tourists, despite the relatively low number of tourist accommodations, as dining is the principal focus and target of tourist spending.</span>
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="4">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">This text aims to show how Mykonos is simultaneously : an observatory, a laboratory, and conservatory for viable junctions between the different evolutions of gastronomy (intermixing, local resistance, simplification, aetheticisation, reinvention, heritagisation) and globalisation processes via dining in a context of international tourist destinations. As quantified data and official statistics are lacking, the methodology is based on both face-to-face interviews with approximately fifteen respondents on the island (including chefs, restaurateurs, restaurant and hotel managers, maître d’s and participants working in the tourism sector and with associations), as well as participant observation that took place between 24 July and 7 August 2012. While observation is the basis for producing knowledge and scientific explanations, participant observation allows observers to understand the facts, practices and major social representations, as well as the finer nuances of underlying factors. Observers can thus place themselves in the shoes of gourmet-minded tourists to better consider and understand the complexity of the switch from daily to irregular routines, from the ordinary to the extraordinary, which is the driving force for an area’s transformation into a tourist destination. Continuous internal observation is made possible via a timeline of events permitting searches for invariables and changes. This continuous analysis of the facts directly and physically questions the meaning of inhabiting a place, even as a tourist ; this, still more than just eating practices, is an essential component for defining the ways in which a place/the world is inhabited.</span>

        <paragraphe num="5">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Mykonos’ opening to the world was not concurrent with its touristification, which began in the 1960s and 1970s, but it remains an identifying structure – as defined by Charles Lévi-Strauss – of the island’s society. While interest in the outside world has contributed to the construction of a local identity, the municipality’s website insists on the ancient tradition of both Aegean and specifically Mykonian cuisines, as well as on early influences in terms of agricultural food products and tastes. Starting in the Cycladic period, “Greek” cuisine started to take form, consisting mainly of wild grains, olives and fresh herbs, via the inclusion of multiple Mediterranean influences : spices (cumin, saffron, etc.), dried foods from Egypt (chickpeas, lentils, etc.), dried or candied fruits (dates, etc.). It was fed at a very early date by travellers and worldwide exchanges such as the spread of vine and grape cultivation which led the Greeks to wine making. More recently, this enhancement of local cuisine by foreign influences has resulted in the assimilation and appropriation of several Latin American plants including the tomato (figure 1) which has since become an emblematic ingredient in Mykonian cuisine and, more widely, Greek and Mediterranean cuisine.</span>
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="6">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Within this logic, the globalisation of work-related human travel patterns has also contributed more generally to the enhancement of Mykonian and Greek cuisine, including through Greek emigration to the United States and, more specifically, California. Despite the distance from their homeland, Californian Greeks have been able to preserve the traditional taste of Greek yoghurt. Then, keeping in mind the sun, the beach, tourism and appetites for ice cream, they managed to create and perfect frozen Greek yoghurt. Homecoming and vacation trips to the homeland allowed this frozen sheep’s milk yoghurt (sometimes made with less-exotic cow’s milk) to be introduced in Greece, and most notably, on Mykonos. Today, the island has at least ten different frozen yoghurt businesses centred around Mykonos Chora, patronised mainly by tourists (figures 2 and 3).</span>
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="7">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Furthermore, immigration from Italy has profoundly and lastingly affected local tastes and, by correlation, dining options on Mykonos ; Italian restaurants (figure 4) and restaurants offering Italian cuisine are numerous. The appetite for Italian flavours grows during the summer with the influx of Italian tourists, notably young people, who spend their July and August holidays on the island via direct low-cost flights from many Italian cities, Rome and Milan in particular.</span>
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="8">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Beyond wholly Italian restaurants, Italian cuisine influences all of the dining options available on the island. Certain internationally-known Italian offerings are available in nearly all restaurants : pizza (one of the five world best-sellers – Fumey, Elmira, 2004), pasta, risotto, and for dessert, tiramisù and cappuccino (one of the five world best-sellers – Fumey, Elmira, 2004). Many restaurants, located primarily within resorts in the south of the island, organise their menus by juxtaposing Greek specialities and Italian dishes (figure 5).</span>
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="9">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">This “Italian flavour” is appreciated, no matter the style of restaurant ; even sandwich shops and fast food establishments are putting their own spin on Italian dishes. Indeed, for the Mykonians themselves as well as for Greek tourists, Italian cuisine (without forgetting Italian wine) is key, constituting an element of social distinction and a characteristic of taste identity. It is indeed considered a fashionable style of cuisine (spread by word-of-mouth and attractive images : heliotropism, togetherness, health, beauty – appropriated by the upper classes, the fashion world and the jet-set crowd). It is tasty and light, made with both raw and cooked vegetables, and close to Greek cuisine with its Greco-Roman roots. However, it is also more refined and diversified, combining small meals (in the Greek style) – and more luxurious dishes. This kind of cuisine elegantly combines historical legacies of taste and modern flavours, all of which can be linked to periods of ancient Roman and medieval Venetian rule, as well as the more recent commercial links between Mykonos and the Tuscan port city of Livorno.</span>
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="10">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">As it has proven to be quite open to outside influences, Mykonian cuisine has, over the past fifty years, also undergone developments related to widening voluntary travel patterns across the world with the expansion of tourism. Similarly to its remodelled urban geography brought on by the construction of tourist accommodations, Mykonos’ cuisine has been “enhanced” by the influence of tourism. The vast majority of the island’s restaurants, especially those located in resorts far from the capital, operate solely for tourists and are only open during the summer season, as are many food, souvenir and craft shops. It appears that tourism is the main springboard for a doubly dynamic gastronomic culture.</span>
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="11">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Firstly, a considerable simplification of culinary preparations and tastes is under way. Greek, as well as more “dominant” cuisines from Italy and France, are often reduced to their most widely recognized and accepted aspects, or even stereotyped or caricatured. Greek salads and moussaka are omnipresent, but can be made in practically infinite variations of ingredients, textures, presentations and freshness. This simplification is not ubiquitous, however. At the same time, likely thanks to tourism, these “tourist” restaurants can be found alongside other establishments offering Mykonian and Greek homestyle cuisine, for example, the To Maereio restaurant in Mykonos Chora and Nicolas Taverna in Platys Gialos. Under a clear North American influence, this simplification may be taken to an extreme with fast food, although the industry remains relatively small on the island where the biggest world-famous brands have very little presence. Thus, restaurants serving hamburgers and steak with French fries (like restaurant Steak House in Mykonos Chora) meet the smallest denominator taste between speed, ease and (even perceived) affordability. In this sense, the island of Mykonos is the perfect illustration of the general craze for the five best-selling “world cuisines” : pizza, burgers, kebab, sushi and cappuccino (Fumey, Elmira, 2004). However, some fast food establishments are also looking to anchor their offers locally. The Sandwich Bar in Mykonos Chora, open 24 hours a day, offers a “souvlaki experience” – the ancient Greek culinary technique of grilling kebab – and boasts “the best souvlaki sandwich of Mykonos”.</span>
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="12">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">On the other hand, depictions of Greek cuisine and other cooking styles from tourists’ countries of origin can lead to culinary innovations. Thus, symbolic dishes or dishes regarded as such, especially popular and peasant dishes, are reworked to respond to health and dietary concerns, including reduced-fat and low-sugar recipes. They may also be improved with new creative ideas. This adaptation to modern notions is equally visible in culinary techniques as in the presentation itself. The Kalita restaurant in Mykonos Chora is an example (figure 6).</span>
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="13">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">In the end, the general pattern is a complex dining experience that is both Greek and international, primarily Italian, more juxtaposed than just simply mixed – as different cultures are combined very little, if at all, there is thus no “fusion cuisine”. It is an ”anchored” kind of cuisine : Greek, or even Mykonian ; or Mediterranean, whether reinvented or not ; and present alongside a more “widespread” cuisine which has been more or less stereotyped. Dining at the Hotel Belvedere in Mykonos Chora presents an interesting summary of the state of commercial culinary offerings in Mykonos. The hotel has two restaurants organised around the outdoor swimming pool : a Greek restaurant, The Belvedere Club (voted best restaurant in Greece in 2009 and 2010 by the Alpha Guide), and a Japanese restaurant, Matsuhisa by Nobu. The Greek restaurant is headed by George Calombaris, a chef of Cypriot origin. He emigrated to Australia where he enjoyed a growing reputation, eventually owning three restaurants in Melbourne and participating in Master Chef Australia. Mixing his Cypriot roots with his experiences in Australia, he reinterprets classic Greek dishes (see “signature” dishes, figure 7), and prepares international dishes “in the Greek style” (figure 8). The Japanese restaurant is owned and run by the very famous and highly publicised Nobu Matsuhisa. The dishes are clearly Japanese and prepared by a team of Japanese chefs. The extensive menu includes sushi, sashimi, tempura, tartare and soups, classic offerings available in other restaurants owned or operated by their respective head chefs. Other offerings included are salads and “special” dishes like beef (not Japanese Kobe beef, but Wagyu cuts from Australia), as well as original desserts such as Toban pears with creme caramel and tofu ice cream.</span>
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="14">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">All in all, the dining experience shows an exceptional understanding of demand from residents, visitors, and, more importantly, temporary residents, reflecting both the need for (re)assurance and the desire for (re)discovery.</span>

        <section niveau="h1">A laboratory of developments in gastronomy through tourist practices</section>
        <paragraphe num="15">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Mykonos’ attractiveness to tourists offers the possibility to analyse changes in gastronomy by revealing new discriminating practices that show particularly significant trends in two tourist “categories” : gays (figure 9) and bobos (fashionable middle-class left-wingers), distinguished by other tourists by their high level of knowledge and their exacting standards with regard to the quality of agricultural food products, mastery of cooking techniques and diversity of tastes. These two central sociocultural “categories” are drawing such an increased amount of attention to food that they have begun to provoke avant-garde developments in gastronomy and spread them to tourist destinations, as well as to permanent residential areas.</span>
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="16">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Firstly, there are two defining microcosms linked to local, small-scale agriculture and artisanal food production under quality labels and official designations of origin, culinary exceptions and rarities, preparations related to specific and original tastes, and fine dining. While the food supply of the island’s restaurants is essentially outsourced (agricultural production being limited by the lack of space, poor soil and arid summer conditions) and consists largely of frozen products, the most sought-after culinary qualities can be found on restaurant menus (with the exception of the great high-end restaurants) with offers of fresh seasonal produce, and environmentally responsible or fair-trade local and regional products. Thus, if a restaurant menu lists food products as having been frozen, the chef or maitre d’ will focus on locally-caught, “typical Mykonian” seafood that is kept alive in an aquarium in the dining room itself – such as sashimi-style scallops at the Matsuhisa by Nobu restaurant in Mykonos Chora, or spaghetti with fresh sea urchin from at Sol y Mar in Kalo Livadi. Other local products include wine made from organic grapes produced on the island itself at the Theoxenia Hotel’s restaurant in Mykonos Chora. A close look at the names of the dishes at the Kalita restaurant, frequented by gay and bobo communities, shows several well-known culinary developments : food products whose geographical origin is guaranteed (sun-dried tomatoes, capers and beans from Santorini ; Corinthian raisins ; Peloponnesian beans), branded agricultural products (organic red Greek saffron from Kozani, Trikalinos brand bottarga from Missolonghi), and dishes made from organic products. Regarding the latter range of offerings, the menu presents an exceptional category – “organic pasta and risotto” – comprising five dishes, including Cretan pasta with grilled shrimp prepared with saganaki, a flavouring made from feta and Chio mastic (figure 10).</span>
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="17">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Whether occurring at specific intervals or more developing over longer periods of time, these developments result in the inclusion of new worldwide trends in cooking and food in relation to health, respect for the environment and organoleptic curiosity. They constitute a determining element in dining options intended for tourists. Their development and geographic spread across the island plays a part in the construction of a brand image for tourism, and feeds tourist influence in Mykonos.</span>
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="18">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Today, this dynamic is spreading from stylish restaurants and international hotels to all food-related businesses. So it is for I Scream, an artisanal ice cream parlour in Mykonos Chora. On its store front, an advertisement reads “homemade ice cream with fresh Greek milk”. They offer original flavours such as mastic (mastiha) and vanilla with an oriental-style cake (ekmek). This is also the case for the Mandarina delicatessen in Mykonos Chora.</span>
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="19">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">The “Aegean Cuisine” quality label (figure 11) displayed by a certain number of restaurants on the island perfectly illustrates the developments in fine dining, made apparent by the habits of gay and bobo tourists especially. The “Aegean Cuisine” programme is an initiative of the Centre for Business and Technological Development of the South Aegean and was implemented via a cooperative effort between the Chambers of Commerce of the Cyclades and the Dodecanese islands. It aims to promote Aegean culinary identity at local, national and international scales through marketing actions and the development of projects intended to guarantee tangible benefits to local businesses such as restaurants, cafés, taverns, food-related businesses and agro-industrial companies. Another of its goals is to encourage firms to be export-oriented and develop gastronomic tourism.</span>
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="20">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Secondly, these two sociocultural “categories” are particularly sensitive to culinary cosmopolitanism and are linked to taste. The restaurants and dining establishments attracting them are openly cosmopolitan, and becoming more and more so. Thus, the identity of the island’s new restaurants reveals an increase in external influences and the intermixing linked to the differing geographical origins of tourists. Thus, new restaurants open and intend to indulge palates from new countries (especially the BRIC countries) : a Chinese and Thai restaurant, Blue Ginger ; an Indian restaurant specialising in curries, Elli ; and a Mexican restaurant, Appaloosa. Similarly, the Kastro bar, near the Panagia Paraportiani Church, offers a Chios mastic-infused vodka.</span>
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="21">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Lastly, these two groups particularly appreciate cuisine associated with festivities – rhythmic music with sexy dancing and atmosphere, for example. Mykonos is therefore not only a veritable breeding ground for gastronomic developments that are visible in other tourist venues, but more specifically an accessible crossroads between gastronomy and festivity. Through seeking sensory arousal, entertainment and the presence of modern trends and uniqueness, party culture brings specific added value to gastronomy and, correlatively, gastronomy may serve as a means of support for parties. Thus, it is the combination of gastronomy and festivity that makes Mykonos a key tourist destination.</span>

        <paragraphe num="22">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">In his 2002 thesis, Richard Florida announced the worldwide emergence of a new ruling social class of young knowledge workers called “creatives”. He stated that the growth and image of a place depends on its power of attraction for artists, engineers, scientists and financiers, insofar as businesses are beginning to prefer these highly-qualified employees (Gravari-Barbas, 2007). To do so, such places must advertise the best they have to offer : new bars and restaurants, nightlife, artistic and musical facilities or renovations for buildings and monuments, for example. Tolerance for the gay community is also necessary (Gravari-Barbas, 2007). In conclusion, the quality and frequency of these activities are of the utmost importance.</span>

        <paragraphe num="23">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Thanks to local and international tourist traffic, many restaurants show a willingness to “reserve” typical characteristics of both original culinary creations and Greek/Mykonian taste preferences. The traditional Mediterranean trilogy – bread or pasta or flour and egg-based dishes, olives and olive oil, and wine – is suitable and lively, although ouzo and beers like Mythos and Alpha are very popular. In a way, Kiki’s Restaurant in Agios Sostis seeks to promote this trilogy to tourists by highlighting the simplicity of cuisine prepared in an establishment that is supposedly without electricity. Meat and fish with potatoes are cooked in foil over coals, or on the grill in an outdoor oven, at the restaurant’s entrance on its shaded terrace. Accordingly, the restaurant is only open during the day and closes at sunset (figure 12).</span>
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="24">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">In the same vein, the restaurant at the Mykonian Ambassador Hotel and Thalasso Center, affiliated with the French hotel chain Relais &amp;amp; Châteaux, reveals a provisional commitment : Greek and, more specifically, Mykonian agricultural food products and culinary preparations, are promoted through themed meals offered every Tuesday at dinner : “discovering traditional Greek delights with the Relais &amp;amp; Châteaux touch”. One of these meals highlights localised products with registered designations of origin. Eggs with fresh tomato and Mykonos louza, Naxos potatoes with almyrikia cheese and cherry tomatoes, pork with green vegetables and rice pudding. Other typical dishes include spetsofai (a soup of sausage and cooked peppers in a tomato sauce), traditional Greek salad, veal with traditional Greek pasta and walnut pie.</span>

            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Beyond its offerings of different agricultural food products, cuisines and tastes, the island of Mykonos reveals the Mediterranean diet’s considerable resilience, which should be understood as a set of technical and sociocultural rules related to food intake.</span>
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="26">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Firstly, this resilience is reflected locally in Mykonos by a reproduction of the model of the Mediterranean diet through the traditional women’s practices of preparing and tasting food. A local women’s association in Mykonos, the Folk and Cultural Association of Mykonian Women (founded in 1979 in the image of Mykonian heroine Mando Mavrogenous, member of the Greek resistance against the Ottomans) aims to reaffirm the mother’s nurturing function and revive the “street banquet” (panigiria), which was intended to maintain neighbourly relations and promote hospitality. In Mykonos Chora, they host night markets in front of the Letho Hotel across from the small beach, where they offer tastings and sell jams, olives, oils, and more. They are accompanied by (retired) amateur musicians who play on antique instruments. They also run an “open restaurant” (figure 13) in the centre of Mykonos Chora where they offer local home-made dishes such as : Mykonian pies made with onions and herbs or cheese, baklava, galaktobureko and loukoumades – fritters soaked in a cinnamon and orange peel syrup. </span>
        </paragraphe>
        <paragraphe num="27">
            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">This resistance is also beginning to resonate around the world due to official recognition of the Mediterranean diet. Since 16 November 2010, it has been inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO, which has labelled it a “common good” on a global scale. According to the application supported and defended by four countries – Greece, Spain, Italy and Morocco : “The Mediterranean diet constitutes a set of skills, knowledge, practices and traditions ranging from the landscape to the table, including the crops, harvesting, fishing, conservation, processing, preparation and, particularly, consumption of food. The Mediterranean diet is characterized by a nutritional model that has remained constant over time and space, consisting mainly of olive oil, cereals, fresh or dried fruit and vegetables, a moderate amount of fish, dairy and meat, and many condiments and spices, all accompanied by wine or infusions, always respecting beliefs of each community. However, the Mediterranean diet (from the Greek diaita, or way of life) encompasses more than just food. It promotes social interaction, since communal meals are the cornerstone of social customs and festive events. It has given rise to a considerable body of knowledge, songs, maxims, tales and legends. The system is rooted in respect for the territory and biodiversity, and ensures the conservation and development of traditional activities and crafts linked to fishing and farming in the Mediterranean communities which Soria in Spain, Koroni in Greece, Cilento in Italy and Chefchaouen in Morocco are examples. Women play a particularly vital role in the transmission of expertise, as well as knowledge of rituals, traditional gestures and celebrations, and the safeguarding of techniques.” Five conditions warrant its inscription on the Intangible Cultural Heritage list. The 16 November 2010 decision states : “the Committee (…) decides that [this element] satisfies the criteria for inscription on the representative list of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity as follows : R.1 : Transmitted from generation to generation, particularly through families, the Mediterranean diet provides a sense of belonging and sharing and constitutes for those who live in the Mediterranean basin a marker of identity and a space for sharing and dialogue ; R.2 : Inscription of the element on the Representative List could contribute to raising awareness of the significance of healthy and sustainable food related practices in other parts of the world, while encouraging intercultural dialogue, testifying to creativity and promoting respect for cultural, environmental and biological diversity ; R.3 : Safeguarding measures focus on raising awareness, transmission, documentation, revitalization as well as legislative actions ; emphasis is placed on strengthening cooperation mechanisms between and among the communities and States concerned ; R.4 : Through several meetings, the communities concerned in seven countries participated in the preparation of the nomination and gave their free, prior and informed consent ; R.5 : The Mediterranean diet has been included in the inventories of the immaterial cultural heritage of the four States under consideration and will be included in a transnational inventory of the Mediterranean currently being prepared.” This heritagisation which covers a set of practices, discourse and images and which exceeds the technical dimension of food production and kitchens, reveals the projected links and experiences lived by tourists between gastronomy and conviviality, on the one hand, and gastronomy and well-being on the other. The Mediterranean diet can therefore be analysed as a cultural heritage centred around tourism.</span>

            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Women stand at the forefront of this process of recognition as a cultural heritage. The application file notes that “women play an important role as keepers of knowledge and experiences, and act as transmitters of the Mediterranean diet, an essential vector of their identity.” The dimension of festivity and conviviality (commensality) has been highlighted over and over again : “As a unique lifestyle determined by the Mediterranean climate and region, the Mediterranean Diet also appears in the cultural spaces, festivals and celebrations associated with it. These spaces and events become the receptacle of gestures of mutual recognition and respect, of hospitality, neighbourliness, conviviality, intergenerational transmission and intercultural dialogue. They are opportunities to both share the present and establish the future. These communities thus rebuild their sense of identity, belonging and continuity, enabling them to recognise this element as an essential component of their common and shared intangible cultural heritage.” Like the actions of the Mykonos women’s association, the panigirias are given particular focus in the application file : “these extraordinary occasions – very frequent in Mediterranean – allow for exchanges and meetings, beyond its own horizons, and promote sharing through parties and local events within neighbouring communities. In the Mediterranean region, everyone is someone’s neighbour (…) the Mediterranean diet constitutes an intangible space benefiting from opportunities to exchange, come together and share between cultures. It is the meeting point between different neighbourhoods and unique cultural characteristics (…) All of this will also help to overcome prejudices and atavistic cultural concepts stemming from different religions, languages or historical episodes, and will therefore serve as an example for others to follow across the world”.</span>

            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">As demonstrated by Olivier Lazzarotti (2009), concerning tangible cultural heritage, “the designation of monuments is linked to support from scholars, scientists and, on occasion, personalities considered to be particularly artistic : renowned (or even officially recognised) historians, architects and artists (…) Words and discussions are therefore a practically exclusive resource for the identification of monuments. Passing from monument to heritage marks a transformation in the memorialising process of recognition ; indeed, the cultural heritage is recognised by the very people who visit it, as it is the eyes that make visible that which, being seen, becomes heritage. Thus, the physical presence of visitors and their perspectives on the object of consideration itself can be seen as constituting the very process of recognition”. The examples of the Mediterranean diet and the island of Mykonos show that what is true for tangible cultural heritage is just as true for the intangible. It is largely tourists who facilitate the heritagisation of the Mediterranean diet by their external perspective and their practices. Heritage exists only if it is practised, tasted and celebrated by tourists.</span>

            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Tourism therefore promotes a local gastronomic originality which becomes a source of attraction for tourists. In this sense, thanks to tourism, the Mediterranean diet has always been a cultural practice with an influence stretching beyond the Mediterranean basin. Tourism is directly involved in heritagisation by its external perspectives, practices, and legitimacy.</span>

            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">According to Michel Onfray, Dionysus can be understood to be the god of energy, movement, and flow : these are the relationships which make up the world. Mykonos, a place favoured by Dionysus, can thus be regarded as a place of the world, an experimental place for globalisation and the relationship between gastronomy and the world at large. Since ancient times, the island has proven its ability to incorporate foreign and exotic agricultural food products and external gustatory and culinary influences before “digesting” them, integrating them into its own identity. In a subtle game of scalar levels, from the Aegean zone, to the entirety of Greece, the Mediterranean basin and ultimately the entire world, Mykonos has developed a complex, attractive food identity with many layers. Through this geometrically variable assembly, the island has become a small-scale version of the whole world’s table. There, a balance has been created and renewed between local roots and external influences, and secondly, a style of dining has been produced and reproduced which combines novelty and distinctiveness in both cooking techniques and food. Mykonian gastronomy has been enhanced by an element of festivity which feeds its attractiveness to tourists. In this gastronomy-world relationship, tourism can be understood as more than a mere mediator ; it is an accelerator and, most importantly, an assessor of globalisation in Mykonos. In its direct relationship to the Other and to Elsewhere, this globalization of the island has in fact been greatly enhanced by the globalisation of tourist mobility. The island enjoys a very positive and attractive tourist image, aided by considerable media coverage around the world. Despite possessing limited accommodation, the island has become a model tourist destination by its ability to display and own its identity on several levels via a global geocultural positioning strategy ; while avoiding the risk of misuse and dissolution of that identity posed by this openness. Furthermore, it can be considered that the island’s openness to tourists has come to strengthen this identity, rather than a trivialise it, and has indeed led to the heritagisation of the Mediterranean diet. It has therefore earned its place in the world as a destination for gastronomic experiences and as a place for tourism and festivities. However, is it possible to say that it is indeed a tourist destination for gastronomy ?</span>

            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Throughout its history, which has been punctuated by the coming together of different groups, and others, in communion or confrontation, Mykonos has, both individually and collectively, succeeded in adjusting and balancing the internal and the external ; the inner real and outer ideal ; the Same and the Different. This intelligibility is the basis of both the island’s attractiveness to tourists and the heritagisation of the Mediterranean diet on a wider scale. Endlessly searching for a universality of practices and social representations of gastronomy, Mykonos has succeeded in ensuring that permanent and temporary residents live together in harmony, but also in guaranteeing the organisation of dining options between the chef-restaurant owner and the consumer, whether local or foreign. Indeed, Mykonian dining reveals an original amalgamation of influences which avoids fusion (or confusion, one could say), disappearance or domination of culinary traditions linked to taste. For the permanent and temporary social groups bringing positive attention to Mykonos, does this not prove by example the philosophical difference between “uniform” and “universal” ?</span>
