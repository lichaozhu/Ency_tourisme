            <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Working in a fluid space between tourism research and policy practice, my research often involves active participation in the policy networks I am researching. This photo was taken at the INTO2015 Innovation and Tourism International Seminar in Palma de Mallorca where we worked with local tourism stakeholders from public, private, and third sectors to explore alternative sharing economy models beyond extractive platform capitalism. In order to maximise the value of my research to a broadest range of stakeholders, policy education and shared learning are integral to the research design. In these research spaces I trace the origin and evolution of policy problems, engage in the shared diagnosis of the issues, and in co-creating actions. This is a very fluid space of participatory action research, where I am constantly and reflexively drawing from theoretical foundations in policy studies, political science, governance, tourism and inquiry-led research, design thinking and pedagogy. </span>
