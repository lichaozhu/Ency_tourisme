The impact of the “economy of
history”: The example of battlefield
tourism in France
David Foulk

“Le tourisme, c’est un trésor national”
Laurent Fabius, former French Foreign Minister,
BFMTV, 11 June 2015

The “economy of history” can be defined as history and historical monuments as a motor
for economic activity, most specifically in the tourism industry. Tourism continues to
hold particular interest for French public policymakers, and given the geostrategic
importance of France during two world wars, battlefield tourism provides the visitor with
either a destination in its own right, or a stop on a longer itinerary. Battlefield tourism
has helped to provide both visitors and jobs to areas in the northern industrial heartland
of France by encouraging visitors towards less traditionally frequented areas. In recent
years, more visitor centres and memorials have opened across the world, including in
France, than during the whole of the twentieth century (Dunkey, Morgan and Westwood,
2011, p. 860). This study will show that battlefield tourism produces tangible results
which reflect positively on the French tourism industry more generally. In this centenary
year of the commemoration of the Battle of Verdun, it is important to take stock of the
options available to policymakers.

Tourism has already begun to attract research from a range of academic disciplines, as
shown by Iles’s research (2008) into sociological aspects that motivate travellers to visit
battlefields, Larique’s historical investigations (2006) and Holgun’s work (2005) on the
commercial ventures in this niche market. Equally, Gondras (2012) has proven that some
of the most authoritative texts on the market for historical tourism are written by the
professionals themselves. However, a multitude of aspects remain to be covered,
including links between battlefield tourism and other forms of historical tourism.

This paper seeks to show the impact of battlefield tourism in France. Initially, the
“economy of history” must be defined before it is possible to explain the effects that it
has engendered in parts of rural France. Secondly, it is necessary to know the context
into which the modern French tourist industry fits as well as the role played by
stakeholders in the “economy of history”. The networks formed between local
professionals and the regional tourist offices are of interest in that they help to improve
the visibility of these sites whilst at the same time encouraging local entrepreneurship.
Finally, the impact of this industry can be discussed. It then becomes possible to analyse
the effectiveness of select sites in attracting both domestic and international tourists. The
paper will explore the economic outcomes that emanate from encouraging such acts of
remembrance and commemoration, the most notable of these being the activity of Leger
Holidays, a British company that offers escorted coach trips to battlefield sites. This will
demonstrate how battlefield tourism generates revenues for companies both inside and
outside French borders. Conclusions will then be drawn as to the importance of the
“economy of history” in France.

The “economy of history”
4

History, and its transmission, has never ceased to captivate the imagination of man. The
need to connect with one’s roots is deeply ingrained within each of us. However, the
manner in which this interest is expressed may take many diverse and differing forms. It
is for this reason that certain people will support a particular football team, following
their previous generations to the same terraces. Others may adopt certain familial
customs and traditions, in order to keep the link to their past alive and vibrant.

5

It is with this in mind that the ultimate variable, to which we are all subject, should be
introduced – emotions. However, the attempt to measure the influence of emotions upon
economic actions can prove to be problematic. The development of economic theory
since the eighteenth century has often disregarded this variable in favour of an attitude
more fitting to the rational perfection of homo economicus, for it is difficult to quantify the
consequences of such an unquantifiable and changeable variant. Nevertheless, it can be
argued that the interdisciplinary perspective offered by the social sciences can help shed
light on such a phenomenon, as was highlighted by recent academic conferences,
including TRAST.1

6

The emotional responses of tourists have been provided with an ideal outlet in the form
of a market based upon battlefield tourism. The visitors, as consumers, have made the
conscious choice to use their limited resources in order to spend their holiday visiting
battlefields. These are sites that have experienced great trauma and suffering yet,
according to D. Lloyd (Lloyd, 1998), people choose to follow a physical or literary guide in
the search of further knowledge, understanding and spirituality. Due to the development
of facilities that cater to this market, quantitative analysis of the revenues received by the
visitor centres becomes possible, and therefore interpretations can be made as to the
economic impact and consequences of the “economy of history”.

7

There are three constituent parts to this motor of economic activity in France. The first
constituent, as investigated in this paper, is battlefield tourism. In France, this
phenomenon is historically centred on the northern frontier with Belgium, and stretches
along the First World War frontline. This is not to suggest that only these battlefields

attract tourists; one can point to Alesia in the Côte d’Or, the site of Caesar’s victory
against the Gauls in 52 BC, or Agincourt and Crecy during the Hundred Years’ War. In the
modern era, sites such as the Normandy beaches can be considered in this vein, whilst
Oradour-sur-Glane in Haute-Vienne attracts a clientele more befitting Lennon and Foley’s
(2000) description of “dark tourism”.
8

The second constituent part consists in the many monuments of France, 43,700 of which
are under legislative protection, attracting a great number of tourists each year (Gondras,
2012, p. 48). These can include famous archaeological sites such as the Lascaux caves in
the Dordogne as well as the multitude of chateaux found in the French countryside, such
as Fontainebleau and Versailles. In addition, aristocratic residences are being converted
into luxury hotels, spas and hunting venues, Château de la Verrerie in the Cher being an
example of the latter. Despite recent works by Gondras (2012), further research is needed
in order to provide firmer conclusions as to the true impact of these attractions upon the
local and national economy of France.

9

Finally, dating from the 1980s there has been an increased interest in France for
historical reconstruction. In towns and villages across the country, including Castillon-laBataille2 in the Gironde, the site of the final battle of the Hundred Years’ War in 1453,
local associations put on shows that attract tourists and locals alike. These
reconstructions generally rely upon the benevolence of volunteers to provide their time
and acting talents as well as their help in the construction of sets, costumes and
production. The success of these shows has been reflected in the fortunes of the Puy du
Fou3 theme park in the Vendée. In 1977, its creators, Philippe de Villiers and Jean SaintBris, decided to write a show that focused on the life of the local Maupillier family, which
spans six centuries. Historical reconstructions and monuments are, however, to remain
objects for further study at this time.

Battlefield tourism and France
10

According to governmental statistics, France is, and has been since 1990, the most
popular world destination for international tourists. The hospitality and tourist
industries represent 7.4% of GDP,4 resulting in a significant proportion of the population
relying upon its continued presence to survive and to thrive in the French economy.
Within this, battlefield tourism as a distinct form of touristic activity has a history that
encompasses both the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Throughout history,
spectators and military observers have followed behind the ranks of combatants in order
to observe, report and testify to the horrors of war, most markedly following the
invention of photography and long-distance telegraph, which allowed for the rapid
transmission of information from reporter to reader. This had precedence in France
during the 1870 siege of Paris by the Prussian army, whereby English and Americans were
solicited through advertisements offering apartments for rent (Horne, 2012; E-book loc.
1453, 15%). However, the objectives of these contemporary observers and battlefield
tourists remain similar – the search for further knowledge. The scale of the mobilisation
led to greater and more personal connections for the peoples of the warring nations,
notably through the loss of a generation of young men. This in turn encouraged the
memorialisation movement, best explained in the seminal works of J. Winter (1985),
which led to a general call for the installation of monuments, thus creating a form of
attraction around which those left behind could channel their grief as well as for those

mourning their lost family members, or for those former combatants seeking to
remember their comrades.
11

The WWI battlefields of northern France are situated on a major European crossing-point,
a frontier that is still heavily traversed each year. With the influxes of tourists,
entrepreneurs are gifted opportunities to provide services, and it is from a commercial
perspective that this paper shall initially look at battlefield tourism. This form of tourism
is of particular importance to the area of the Vallée de la Haute Somme, as can be seen by
the six different museums counted in surveys of the area’s tourist activity – all of which
use the First World War as their subject.

12

Using statistics collected by the local tourist offices in the area, and at each of the
attractions, a table has been collated to show the number of visits recorded at 7 sites over
a period of 17 years from 1998 to 2015.5 Figures are partial because certain sites did not
exist at the beginning of the period in question, for instance the Visitor Centre at
Thiepval. As can be seen in Figure 1, the general trend at four of the attractions has
remained relatively unchanged, namely the Historial de la Grande Guerre, the Musée
Somme 1916, the P’tit Train de la Haute Somme and the Musée Franco-Australien. Two
attractions have managed to surpass the others – the Mémorial Terre-Neuvien de
Beaumont Hamel and the Visitor Centre at Thiepval. Both attractions reached peak
attendance in 2014, receiving respectively 192,766 and 214,146 visitors. Incidentally, the
month of October 2014 was the busiest month for both attractions. This suggests that
battlefield tourists travel outside of periods of high touristic influx, possibly to take
advantage of cheaper accommodation prices. Furthermore, both attractions experienced
large falls in their visitor numbers in 2009, 21.9% at the Memorial Terre-Neuvien and
29.5% at the Visitor Centre at Thiepval. This drop could be explained by difficulties in the
tourism sector following the economic downturn worldwide in 2008, which in turn led to
fewer international tourists visiting the sites.

13

Prior to the centenary commemorations in 2014, visitor numbers to the majority of the
museums were on a stable trajectory, improving their frequentation year upon year but
only very steadily, apart from the Musée et Mémorial Sud-Africain which saw a fall
between 2006 and 2007. However, thanks to the commemorations, most sites saw a large
increase in their statistics. This improvement seems to be reflected in the numbers of
hotel rooms booked in the Somme. Since 2012, following a drop of 2%, a recovery has
been underway and 2015 saw the largest number of arrivals in the hotels. With an average
of 23.4% of bookings coming from international tourists, clearly the attractions in this
region appeal to a foreign clientele.6

The importance of stakeholders to the “economy of
history”
14

France’s long history has provided the backdrop upon which an entire industry has been
created and exploited. Each battle, every monument and different historical protagonists
have provided local communities with a product that can be utilized by the various
stakeholders. However, not all sites are created equal and certain sites attract more
visitors than others, as has been seen. For a study of the true impact of battlefield tourism
on the local economy to hold true, further efforts need to be taken to bring to light those
stakeholders, be they owners of hotels and restaurants in the surrounding areas, their
staffs, owners of small commercial enterprises offering guides, or travel agents in the
traditional sense as well as their digital equivalents. These stakeholders should not be
limited to those who solely make their living directly from the receipts of tourist
revenues. The term “stakeholder” must also include those members of the community
who are involved in the secondary services to which tourists are attracted, for example,
the local supermarkets. These members of communities are not necessarily financially
recompensed, yet all help to drive an important constituent of France’s national wealth.
As has been duly noted by scholars (Raboteur, 2000, p. 7), the economics of tourism has, in
general, failed to attract much academic interest. Historical tourism, and the impact that
this phenomenon can have upon local economies, has also fallen victim to this same
neglect.

15

If the analysis of J.-L. Caccomo is adopted, regarding the market for the tourist industry,
the price of the product is heavily influenced by the traditional demand-side
considerations including quality, taste and revenue, as well as supply-side factors relating
to the cost of production as well as fiscal policy (Caccomo, 2007, p. 19). The importance of
a favourable governmental policy, one which fosters and aids the development of resorts
and attractions, becomes evident. The French Interior Ministry accords great significance

to the impact of the tourist industry on the national economy; indeed, it affirms that
France holds a positive balance of trade in this sector of €10.3 billion. 7 Therefore, it is of
national and international interest to know more about this industry, which is so vital to
the economic fate of the country.
16

Using the statistics provided by the French General Department of Enterprises covering
the years 2005–2012, shown in Table 1, it can be seen that an increasing number of
businesses have been entering the tourism marketplace in general. Although certain
years of the surveys are missing, notably data relating to 2008, conclusions can still be
drawn regarding the health of the French tourism industry. Following the economic
downturn in 2008, increased efforts by central government to encourage entrepreneurial
activity seem to have translated into stable growth, in particular in the accommodation
sector. The large increase in the numbers of restaurants over the period could be a
perverse consequence of the economic crisis. By aggravating existing structural
weaknesses in France’s employment market, the crisis led to large numbers of people
being encouraged to start their own businesses. This was facilitated by the creation of a
new form of business entity, the autoentrepreneur, under the Loi sur le modernisation de
l’économie, passed on 4 August 2008 (Hagège and Masson, 2010). However, as can be seen
by the seemingly incongruous result for the numbers of restaurants in 2011, a drop of
49,820 on the previous year, those who started businesses under this model did not
necessarily survive the difficulties that emerged from the tightening of commercial credit
(European Commission, 2009), twinned with the equally high employment and social
charges. This fall came in spite of the lowering of VAT to 5.5% undertaken in 2009. 8 The
increasing numbers of travel agencies following 2009 could reflect the widespread
adoption in France of the technological advances linked to the Internet, thereby allowing
more varied options for those entrepreneurs looking to exploit this medium. In light of
these statistics, it seems evident that questions should be asked relating to the part
played by these businesses, their workforce and the entrepreneurs who have driven this
growth.

Until now, the links between local business and battlefield tourism have proven obscure.
However, and in large part due to the centenary commemorations, these links have been
highlighted by the regional tourist offices, firstly to maximise both the visibility of local

Mondes du Tourisme, 12 | 2016

trade, and secondly to encourage the transmission of the past. At Péronne, the Historial
de la Grande Guerre, an award-winning museum9 dedicated to the Battle of the Somme, is
leading the way in underlining the historical interest amongst shops and other forms of
business. The exhibition of photos of 20 Péronnais business owners to mark the twentieth
anniversary of the Historial – 20 Ans, 20 Commerçants – shows both the support for, and the
necessity of, such attractions in the local economy. Café owner, butcher, engraver, shoeseller, photographer – diverse tradespeople take an interest in the promotion of their
communities. One could suggest that this has been motivated, in part, by self-interest, as
a thriving town attracts more visitors and the virtuous cycle continues. On the other
hand, it becomes clear that sites linked to the battlefield are one of the few attractions in
this predominantly agricultural landscape far from the cities in the locality, such as
Amiens or Arras. The captions that accompany each photograph offer an opportunity to
explain the personal connection between the subject and the object they hold, all picked
from the museum’s collection. The contact details and opening hours of their respective
businesses are indicated, along with the supporters of the project such as the European
Union, the French local and central governments and media groups. This support is
echoed by other business owners, linked directly to the tourist market in the locality. The
four campsites and multiplicity of hotels that surround Péronne help to cater for the
different nationalities which cross France’s Northern (Nord) region, principally Belgian,
Dutch, German and British. The development opportunities that these businesses
generate have allowed for the creation of employment, in particular in the food, beverage
and hospitality industries. Some of the tradespeople talked of the doubling of their
enterprises to cope with growing demand.10 It appears that history, and battlefields in
particular, can indeed be seen as drivers for the local economy in northern France.
18

Stakeholders play an important part in any analysis of a given market. When one thinks
of battlefield tourism, the tourist themselves and the tour operator are the first that
come to mind. However, there are numerous others who operate in this sector; some are
salaried, whereas some offer their time charitably. These employees can include the staff
of visitor centres, the guides employed either by tour operators or by local public-sector
institutions such as the tourist office, transport companies operating coach trips, or even
private rental agencies.

19

In the areas that have been touched by battles of the First World War, tourism offers a
boost for local employment, especially when considering the closing of the last French
coal mines at the turn of the new millennium in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais mining basin.
Therefore, the restaurant owners and local shop owners must be considered as forms of
tertiary stakeholders, who operate not simply to cater for the demands of the battlefield
tourists, but who are nonetheless beneficiaries of their custom. These stakeholders offer
their professional expertise and their local knowledge to battlefield tourists, as was
highlighted in the 20 Ans, 20 Commerçants exhibition at Péronne. Those who run and work
in these establishments are reliant upon the economy of history, as such services are tied
to the passing trade that is offered by the battlefield tourists.

20

Tourists use many different forms of transportation to arrive at their chosen destination.
This is highlighted in the publicity produced by the regional tourist boards, offering
prepared automobile routes, complete with road-signing, as can be seen in Figure 2.
Equally, walking guides and maps have been produced by companies including the wellrespected Michelin guides. These comprehensive maps of the battlefields have been
published since 1917, at the same time as the combat raged. They have, nevertheless,

been completely updated to include events and routes introduced for the centenary
commemorations.

21

In order to foster closer links between local trade and the historical attractions, a scheme
has been implemented following a coordinated effort by four regional actors: the
Historial de la Grande Guerre, Sommetourisme, the Musée Somme 1916 and the Chamber
of Commerce for Amiens-Picardie. The aim was to form a network of professionals who
could encourage the battlefield tourists to make better use of the services on offer in the
locality. These include restaurateurs, tourist offices, transportation professionals,
accommodation professionals, and the sites themselves. Their membership is indicated
by a red and green logo of a poppy that is affixed to the front of the establishment. What
this signifies is that the member will provide practical information for the tourist relating
to the battlefield sites and their environs, thereby allowing the tourist to make the most
of their visit, and at the same time allowing the professional to indicate the presence of
fellow members. One form of encouragement given to the tourist is a book of coupons
that offers discounts to museums in the area. This offers an incentive whilst providing
information that might otherwise have gone unseen. Nonetheless, this model is not
limited to the area around the Somme. Similar partnerships exist in other areas of
northern France and Belgium, such as the Northern France Battlefield Partner scheme,
the Passeurs de Mémoire in the Aisne, and the 2014–18 Remembrance Partner Scheme
around Flanders fields.

Memorialisation and its central role in the “economy
of history”
22

The industrialisation of war left indelible marks on the French countryside and therefore
allowed for the development of memorialisation and the subsequent transformation of
the landscape into an object of attraction for the tourist in its own right. Prior to this,

Mondes du Tourisme, 12 | 2016

8

The impact of the “economy of history”: The example of battlefield tourism in...

memorialisation was reserved for the elites. This process of societally internalising the
events of the past became something opened up to all who gave their life, regardless of
country of birth or position in life. However, with the passing of the veterans,
memorialisation began to take on a different meaning. Whereas those involved did not
need reminding of the causes of the war, subsequent generations risked losing the
messages that had been learnt with the blood, sweat and sacrifice of their elders.
Memorialisation became highly implicated in the transmission of these messages in an
effort to try and avoid further carnage.
23

As this study focuses upon the financial implications of battlefield tourism, the
flourishing of support for memorial projects for the First World War in the north of
France since the beginning of the twenty-first century holds special importance, as is
attested by the founding of visitor centres. The small village of Thiepval, 30 kilometres
from Péronne, is at the forefront of efforts to encourage the remembrance of the 945,000
French, German and British soldiers who lost their lives during the battles of the Somme,
which took place during 1916 and continued into 1917. There are two closely linked
attractions that aid in the transmission of knowledge about this traumatic event.

24

The Historial de la Grande Guerre, housed in the Château de Péronne,11 houses over
70,000 pieces relating to the First World War and stages temporary exhibitions that focus
on different aspects of the war, notably a reconstruction of a Saint-Chamand tank,
alongside its permanent trilingual displays. This approach offers the tourist a truly
comparative approach, allowing the war to be seen from the perspectives of the different
nationalities involved in the fighting. The Historial is twinned with the Franco-British
Memorial and Visitor Centre at Thiepval. This memorial was constructed between 1928
and 1932 from the designs by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the prolific British architect previously
commissioned to plan New Delhi and the Cenotaph in London. The Franco-British
Memorial is inscribed with the names of the 72,205 British and South African servicemen
declared missing-in-action and who have no recorded grave.12 Their names form a
sombre banner, etched onto the 16 pillars that support the 45-metre-high arch. The
visitor centre, which was initially launched in 1998 and led by Sir Frank Sanderson, grew
from a collective feeling that the existing facilities were inadequate to fulfil their raison
d’être of welcoming and educating those who came to visit the site. The project was built
upon an Anglo-French collaboration to raise funds, and was finished in 2004, opening its
doors to visitors the same year. The Le Corbusier-inspired structure houses a permanent
exhibition, which was recently expanded with the addition of a 60-metre-long
monumental fresco, drawn by the artist and journalist Joe Sacco, depicting the first day of
the Battle of the Somme.13 The memorial and the cemetery that surround it are
maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, funded proportionally by the
governments of the Commonwealth nations relative to the number of graves.14

Figure 3. Graphical representation of attendances to the historical attractions at Thiepval and
Péronne, 2004–2011

Illustration, by the author, based on statistics in Annex 3.
25

As we can see in Figure 3, for the period 2004–2011 the number of visitors to these
cultural sites has fluctuated, both positively and negatively, and nor were the visitor
numbers equally distributed between the two attractions. The Historial was consistently
less frequented when compared to the Visitor Centre, most notably in the year 2008, with
a difference of 80,859. It can be reasonably argued that this has been caused by the
imposition of an entry fee at the Historial for access to its wider-ranging collection of
artefacts. This entry fee of €7.50 for adults, and €3.80 for concessions, is clearly sufficient
to drive a number of battlefield tourists towards its free-to-enter sister institution, even
when one takes into account the discount on offer from the Somme Battlefields’ Partner
scheme. As was explained by Raboteur, price is a major contributory factor in the demand
for attractions (Raboteur, 2000, p. 29). However, when considering the Historial, visitors
are still prepared to pay for the attraction, despite being offered an alternative at no cost.
It is not possible to categorise battlefield tourism in terms of the effects of being a Veblen
product, a bandwagon effect or any form of snob effect (Dwyer, Forsyth and Dwyer, 2011,
p. 40). The price of entry is neither too high to be prohibitive, nor are the numbers of
visitors sufficient to suggest a bandwagon effect in progress. This suggests that there are
further factors that need to be taken into account when considering cultural attractions
and their economic consequences, namely emotion in this case. This concept causes great
difficulty to the social scientist, for emotion is difficultly quantifiable. However, it would
be disingenuous to suggest that the choice of destination was not linked intrinsically to
what the traveller seeks to gain from their holiday. The pursuit of historical knowledge
and emotional connection provide the draw to battlefield tourists, and these cannot be
attributed to other activities available in this formerly industrial area. In large part,
people visit the area for the battlefields and this predominance is demonstrated in the
literature published by the tourist offices. It must be acknowledged that great stock is
placed in these historical attractions by the local community, despite the nature of the
draw. Nevertheless, the pricing policy of the Historial seems to be successful in attracting
visitors, as three quarters are prepared to pay the cost of entry to the museum.

26

When further pieces of data are considered, including the nationalities of the visitors, we
begin to see a different picture emerging. The Historial welcomes a large percentage of its
visitors from inside the Hexagone itself (70%), with only 30% of its clients coming from

Mondes du Tourisme, 12 | 2016

10

The impact of the “economy of history”: The example of battlefield tourism in...

abroad.15 This suggests that French tourists are more prepared to pay to partake in the ex
hibitions. It is likely that there is commercial reasoning behind this. Considering that 90%
of those travelling to the Visitor Centre at Thiepval are British, and when considered
alongside Iles’s findings relating to her own experiences on a guided battlefield tour (Iles,
2008, pp. 138–154), we can imagine that a large proportion will have come as part of an
organised commercial tour (Iles, 2008, p. 142). With a limited amount of time in which to
visit the monuments, the aim of these companies is to condense the information housed
within the museum by the use of an experienced tour guide, thereby allowing their
clients to acquire this knowledge without the additional time needed to tour the museum
itself. However, this presumption does not entirely reflect reality as many British tourists
do indeed come individually, and they integrate their visits to the battlefields into a
wider travel itinerary. Domestic tourists are not necessarily subject to the same time
constraints as their foreign counterparts and they can therefore opt to see the museum
without resorting to the expense of hiring a tour guide. This may explain the difference
in the numbers of domestic and international visitors coming to these attractions.
27

The narrowing of visitor numbers between the Visitor Centre at Thiepval and the
Historial could plausibly indicate the wide-reaching impact of the financial crisis that
began in 2008. As can be seen in Figure 2, the Historial, more frequented by French
visitors, saw a lower percentage fall in visitors of 10.2% between 2008 and 2011. The
Visitor Centre at Thiepval saw a greater drop in attendances over the same period, with a
fall of 20.9%. This suggests that the mostly British clientele were choosing not to use
guided tours to the Visitor Centre in the same numbers as before. Whilst the numbers of
French customers to the Historial did decline, the significance of the change was much
less statistically pronounced.

28

However, it must be recognized that, whilst the aims of the two sites remain the same –
that is to say, to educate and to remember – the way in which they meet their aims are
very different. The Historial at Péronne is a museum in the traditional sense of the term,
a place to collect and to put objects on public display; the Visitor Centre and memorial at
Thiepval is a place of commemoration and a site for collective memorialisation. This
means that they appeal to different audiences. The memorial at Thiepval seeks to impress
the visitor by its size; it is predominantly a place for remembrance of the British
servicemen who died, and thus offers more limited appeal than its sister institution. The
Historial at Péronne takes a much less partisan approach, by offering the permanent
trilingual exhibition, and exhibits from all the countries involved in order to reflect the
realities of the war in their geographic context, taking the visitor on a tactile tour of the
events. Whereas the only thing required to appreciate the Franco-British Memorial at
Thiepval is a walk around, the Historial and its many exhibits do not necessarily tell their
story immediately, thereby requiring more time to experience, especially the audio-visual
and tactile computer technology implemented since its refurbishment in 2016.

29

Another site that fits into the paying model is the Mémorial de Verdun. 16 This museum,
situated in the town of Verdun in the département of the Meuse, has been closed to the
public for renovation since September 2014, yet is a site that has attracted large numbers
of visitors ever since it opened in 1967. Designed by the architects M. Bidault and C.
Legrand, the structure houses 1000 m² of floor space devoted to the history of the costly
Franco-German battle in 1916. As we can see from the statistics of those who visited the
museum, a mean average of 109,582 during the period 2006–2013,17 there were more
tourists enticed to visit this memorial. This could be explained by the relative ages of the

sites. The Mémorial de Verdun is much older and therefore more established than its
counterpart. Equally, the site of this memorial is in France; there are therefore many
more families affected, and whose descendants are within the range of viable travel.
Verdun is a larger town than Péronne, both in demography and the number of attractions
– according to INSEE, for the year 2013, 19,144 inhabitants lived in Verdun, 18 whereas
8,142 people were recorded for Péronne.19 Verdun has become a centre for battlefield
tourism and related activities, including a special bus service to take tourists to the
different positions along the line, and a subterranean fort dating from the sixteenth
century that housed both men and material during the battles nearby. The ferocity of the
fighting attracted attention as soon as the fighting ceased, with numerous cities granting
honours to the town for the bravery of its inhabitants. It has therefore gained more
exposure amongst tourists and, arguably more importantly, in the press. The Mémorial
de Verdun has featured in publications such as the magazine Batailles, in May 2010, as well
as in the local newspaper L’Est Républicain, in May 2011. Whilst the readership of these
publications may be limited, L’Est Républicain prints 134,775 copies on average each month
;20 the publications reach a regional audience above all. A national memorial nearby, the
Ossuary of Douaumont, served as a backdrop to the night of television programmes
devoted to commemorations of Verdun,21 on 29 May 2016. This form of mass publicity
allows the site and the nearby town to remain in the public consciousness. Although the
promotion of tourism is not a new phenomenon, it can be argued that, in the aftermath of
the economic downturn, domestic demand is of renewed importance to policymakers, as
has been demonstrated by the comments of Laurent Fabius, the former French Foreign
Minister, in the citation that opened this article.
30

This leads back to the main premise of this paper: the impact that these domestic and
international tourists have upon the community around which their interests are
centred, and the way in which battlefield tourism also generates revenues for companies
both inside and outside French borders. The issue will be examined on multiple levels,
beginning with the sites themselves, followed by the investments that have been effected
to bring them to their current positions, and then moving on to the national level by
analyzing the numbers of employers and employees involved in the tourist industry as a
whole and considering an example of how the demand for tourism in France can help
support business overseas.

The impact of battlefield tourism
31

In order to better understand the impact of battlefield tourism, different variables can be
investigated. The first concrete measure that can be seen is the local employment, for not
all stakeholders are self-employed and must look for employment. At Verdun, the
regional committee for tourism has published statistics on the economic boons created by
tourism. From their statistics (Observatoire Lorrain du Tourisme, 2016, pp. 12–14), stating
that 36.6% of the 82,000 workers in this industry are employed in Lorraine, it can be
calculated that 30,012 are employed in tourism. Considering that the Ossuary of
Douaumont is the fifth most visited site in this area, these positive effects of battlefield
tourism can be seen more clearly.

32

Secondly, with regard to the Historial de la Grande Guerre at Péronne, it is essential to
ensure that revenue calculations are effected for these attractions, as they have such a
significant economic impact on the local economy. If a low-end estimate of the gross

Mondes du Tourisme, 12 | 2016

12

The impact of the “economy of history”: The example of battlefield tourism in...

revenues accumulated by the Historial de la Grande Guerre is produced, without
deducting for the cost of overheads, it can be calculated that the attraction made €275,044
, using 2011 data. Equally, being more optimistic and assuming that every visitor was
paying the maximum tariff of €7.50, it can be estimated that €542,850 was taken from
paying tourists. In reality, it can be assumed that the actual receipts for these two sites
were somewhere in between these two estimates.
33

These sites help to illustrate the collective spending power of those tourists who visit
memorial centres. It can be said that the higher the demand created by the tourists, the
more opportunities for entrepreneurship to flourish. At the most basic level, it is for this
reason that the number of businesses involved in the tourist industry in France has been
increasing since 2006, with over 900,000 jobs provided nationally in this sector. 22
However, when considering the large numbers of tourists who come to France each year,
84.7 million in 2013, it is apparent that the vast majority do not necessarily come with the
intention of partaking in battlefield tourism.

34

Nevertheless, significant investment has been injected into structures catering for this
niche market, especially since the end of the 1990s, and accelerating from the beginning
of the twenty-first century. This investment has been both pecuniary and physical, taking
the form of monetary donations as well as the time spent campaigning to make these
structures more visible to the public. More than 2,000 financial gifts helped to fund the
creation of the Visitor Centre at Thiepval. Moreover, they came from individuals,
including the benefactor who gave £1 for each name on the memorial, or the £5,000 gift
received from the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams. Other donations
were gifted by trusts, such as the Dulverton Trust which donated £25,000, together with
private companies, including HSBC, British American Tobacco and Unilever. Local and
national government helped by donating, including the £40,000 received from the British
Foreign and Commonwealth Office. A significant proportion was financed by the
European Union, and the expertise of different organizations, including the Imperial War
Museum and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, was put at the disposal of the
campaign. Eurotunnel offered its own support to the project by allowing free travel to
members of the commission. In total, the amount raised by the EU, the General Council of
the Somme and the CAF Thiepval Project came to £1,906,000, or €2,647,000. 23

35

Due to their philanthropic nature, these donations cannot be treated as traditional
economic products, for this expenditure serves no quantifiable human need other than
the desire to perpetuate the memory of a historic event. The act of giving can therefore
be qualified as playing an important part in the economics of emotion, for it relies
entirely upon the moral character of a given economic actor in order to take place. This
fusion of both history and emotion in the economic context is a self-perpetuating
phenomenon that is unlikely to be halted, considering man’s insatiable desire for
knowledge of the past and of the darker elements of life, as well as death.

36

A central element of economic activity is the search for profit. Battlefield tourism has
attracted a number of entrepreneurs offering specialized tours, such as those formerly
offered by Major Holt, prior to the acquisition of Holt’s Battlefield Tours by Leger
Holidays in 2014. Across France, Leger Holidays organises trips to many different sites
relating to both the First and Second World Wars.24 Leger’s accounts show that, despite a
relatively modest cash turnover of £156,282, the company Leger Holidays Ltd records
assets of £5.3 million alongside liabilities of £3.3 million, with a net worth of £2 million. 25
The fact that this company is still trading, 36 years after its creation in 1979, stands

Mondes du Tourisme, 12 | 2016

13

The impact of the “economy of history”: The example of battlefield tourism in...

testament to the business opportunities afforded to entrepreneurs ready to participate in
the market for escorted coach holidays. Their initial forays into the niche sector of
battlefield tours came in the early 2000s and concentrated on the Western Front during
World War One, and the D-Day landings in Normandy.26 These holidays have since become
a mainstay in their portfolio, which has grown to over 45 tours, encompassing wars from
different epochs. The customer base that makes use of Leger Holidays is predominantly
centred in the UK; however, a number of overseas clients do find out about the tours
thanks to the Internet and word of mouth. The age and cultural demographic of visitors is
incredibly broad, and ranges from veterans to couples, schoolchildren to all-male groups.
As has been underlined by Iles (2008), and subsequently reiterated by Leger Holidays, the
primary motivation for undertaking these trips is primarily historical, either to visit
specific memorials or to undertake familial research. A number of criteria are used by the
company when selecting the local amenities used during their coach trips. The first is
proximity: hotels and restaurants need to be located centrally in relation to the areas
being visited. The second is quality: generally, Leger use three-star accommodation as the
standard is in keeping with their desire to please customers, yet at the same time this
impacts on the holidays’ running costs. Understandably, cost and standards are of
paramount importance, as they hold the key to attracting customers, ensuring that these
become return clients and that they will be predisposed to recommend Leger to their
friends and family. Moreover, significant responsibility is accorded to the guides, both in
terms of satisfying the customer, but also in designing the individual routes. The tour
guides are generally the best informed regarding offers available for larger parties in
their localities, and it is therefore they who decide where the group should eat at lunch,
as the hotels are used purely on a bed-and-breakfast basis. The chief battlefield guide is
the designer of the itineraries offered by Leger Holidays. This therefore offers scope for
the adoption of tours based on relevant anniversaries or customer feedback. However,
tours are being constantly refreshed, revised and rerouted. The itinerary “Set Europe
Ablaze: SOE, SAS and the French Resistance” followed a route that led to the south-west of
France; the tour was introduced in 2012 but dropped at the end of 2014. This form of
renewal allows the company to offer a service to clients whose historical interests are
diverse yet who wish to follow the format of a guided coach tour, and therefore see a
maximum of sites in a limited period of time. As has been noted, Leger were not the first
to offer battlefield tours, and their success in the sector of guided coach tours led them
into this niche market. Their acquisition of Holt’s Battlefield Tours in 2014 marked an end
to this particular commercial conflict. The recent spate of anniversaries of both the First
and Second World Wars has attracted other tour operators to offer a number of basic
tours, but Leger are still identified as the leading specialist in this domain by the diversity
of their trips. Their work, by the offering of battlefield tours, helps towards the process of
memorialisation and remembrance. The school parties that they transport and the
university research they aid help to accelerate the transmission of knowledge relating to
this period. However, as a company, Leger Holidays are well aware that, from a
commercial standpoint, it is this interest from the public that enables them to continue
trading. They should therefore be qualified as important actors in the economy of
history.

Conclusions
37

As has been shown, the importance of the tourism industry to France is vital both for its
economy as well as towards its development in the cultural sphere, and is one in which
France has led for many years. Tourism is a motor that attracts both entrepreneurial
effort as well as encouraging the restoration of historic sites and the enlargement of the
country’s cultural heritage. Battlefield tourism, as a niche market in this sector, has
encouraged the reinvention of certain areas of the country that were prime examples of
deindustrialisation. This has allowed them to capitalize upon their historic past and for
tourism to flourish. This successful conversion is the mark of a true “post-industrial
society”, to use the term popularized by Bell (1976). It is only fitting that the destructive
power of the deadly arms and machines from the industrial era should be the precursor
for a further transformation in the French countryside, from an industrial heartland into
a tourist attraction. Nevertheless, a fuller investigation into the costs and benefits that
impact upon the local population is required, at least in terms of economic and social
considerations.

38

The “economy of history”, history as a motor for economic activity, utilises natural
inquisitiveness as a means of supporting itself financially. If consumers did not feel the
need to frequent museums and visitor centres, this market would cease to function and
numerous attractions would have to close their doors to the public. Despite tax
exemptions, donations of time and manpower, as well as support from both local and
national government, when considering the very high barriers to entry, cultural tourism
is often far from the minds of most entrepreneurs. However, as has been shown by the
successful ventures of Leger Holidays, profit is indeed there to be earned by those willing
to take the risk. This raises important questions as to the need for innovation in the
historical tourism sector, both in France and internationally. Equally, the introduction of
new technology in the museum experience is already underway, filtering through at the
Historial de la Grande Guerre following its recent refurbishment. Such improvements are
already being made, yet they merely help to add to the ever-increasing costs involved in
operating a visitor centre. These do not simply include the maintenance and upkeep of
the site and the exhibitions, but also include those funds allocated to financing further
academic research, and projects for younger students. However, such undertakings are
not simply beneficial pedagogically and nor is the benefit exclusive to the visitor who
attends these attractions; they also benefit the historical and cultural heritage of France
as a whole. It has been argued that battlefield tourism is a self-perpetuating phenomenon,
as donations to the Visitor Centre at Thiepval included the names of Major and Mrs Holt
as representatives of the first generation of entrepreneurs in the “economy of history”
following the Second World War.

39

The part played by the different stakeholders in this economy is varied and wide-ranging,
stretching from those directly linked to the visits of the tourists themselves to those
whose businesses are helped by the presence of tourists yet who are not entirely reliant
upon their custom. The networks that have been created with the input of stakeholders
offer a means to increase their visibility amongst the tourists whilst, at the same time,
helping to educate and enlighten the visitors as to the local cultural heritage nearby. It is
in part thanks to such schemes including the Somme Battlefields’ Partner scheme that
connections between local business and the attractions have multiplied and thrived, as

16

demonstrated by the exhibition 20 Ans, 20 Commerçants. It is equally clear that there was a
significant increase in visits to sites around the Somme at the beginning of the centenary
celebrations in 2014, which, although slightly falling in 2015, looks set to be repeated in
2016. However, it remains to be seen whether recent events in France, which have begun
to be felt in the tourist sector, will have a notable effect on battlefield tourism.
40

In order to fully understand the scope of the “economy of history” in France, further
investigation needs to be conducted into the two remaining constituent parts, namely
monuments and chateaux as well as the newly developing niche of historical theme parks
and the more interactive historical “experience”. These types of attractions have helped
to cement the reputation of France as being amongst the most sought-after and royally
approved of destinations, as demonstrated by the 2015 visit of King Salman of Saudi
Arabia to Château de l’Horizon at Vallauris.27 Such research would allow for a clearer
image to be formed as to the state of the French historical tourism industry, and thereby
provide indications for future work, as has been called for by both professionals and
academics.

The impact of the “economy of history”: The example of battlefield tourism in...

ABSTRACTS
The “economy of history” in France, or history as a motor for French economic activity, is of
great importance to those areas of the country most affected by the First and Second World
Wars. The attraction of France to tourists is a well-known, and quantifiable, phenomenon, yet the
impact of battlefield tourists on both the local and national economies has remained hitherto
unknown.
Battlefield tourism attracts enthusiasts both from within France’s borders, as well as those
journeying from further afield. This study seeks to show the relative importance of this niche
market for those French villages that have been the most heavily touched by these historical
events, making use of both official statistics as well as those published by the centres themselves,
most notably the Historial de la Grande Guerre at Péronne and the Visitor Centre at Thiepval.
However, the economic consequences are not simply felt within France, but also cross
international borders along with those undertaking the journey, illustrated by the case study of
Leger Holidays.
L’économie de l’histoire définit l’histoire comme moteur de l’activité économique. Elle est d’une
importance majeure dans les régions de la France les plus impactées par la première et la
seconde guerre mondiales. L’attraction des touristes pour les champs de bataille est un
phénomène bien connu et quantifiable, mais leur impact économique est peu abordé.
Le tourisme des champs de bataille attire l’enthousiasme des touristes de France aussi bien que
de ceux venant d’en dehors de ses frontières. Cette étude cherche à montrer l’importance
relative de ce marché de niche, en utilisant les statistiques officielles gouvernementales ainsi que
des données privées, comme celles trouvées pour l’Historial de la Grande Guerre à Péronne et le
Centre de visite à Thiepval. Or les conséquences économiques se font sentir au-delà de la France ;
elles traversent les pays avec ces touristes, comme le montre l’étude de Leger Holidays.
