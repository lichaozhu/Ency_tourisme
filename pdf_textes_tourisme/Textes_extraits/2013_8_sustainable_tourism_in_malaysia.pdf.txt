Abstract. The success of tourism has been conventionally measured by tourist arrivals and revenues, but today this is not
enough to maintain competitiveness. The current challenges of tourism development in developing countries are the tug-of-war
between tourism development plans for economic purposes and sustainable tourism plans. In most of the cases there are
reciprocal relationships between “tourism development” and “sustainability”. The context is significantly different from country
to country when the analysis is focused on economic development goals of tourism. The economic goal of the country, private
partnership, and local community involvement together with customer’s expectations make tourism a complicated area for
sustainable practices. This paper elucidates the performance of “doing tourism” in a sustainable manner complying with the
National Sustainable Tourism Policy of Malaysia. It is found Malaysia has a competitive sustainable tourism plan, which has a
strong linkage with the goals of public, private and NGOs’ goal on socio-economic development. However there is a significant
gap in incorporating policies on the macro level of the tourism system.

Résumé. On mesure généralement le succès du tourisme au flux des touristes et aux revenus qui en sont tirés, mais
ces critères ne suffisent plus aujourd’hui à garantir sa compétitivité. Dans les pays émergents, les enjeux actuels en
matière de développement touristique font l’objet d’une lutte acharnée entre plans de développement du tourisme
à des fins économiques et plans pour un tourisme durable. Dans la plupart des cas, il y a réciprocité entre
“développement du tourisme” et “durabilité”. Le contexte est tout à fait différent d’un pays à l’autre lorsque l’accent
est mis sur les objectifs de développement économique du tourisme. L’objectif du pays au plan économique,
l’engagement des partenaires privés et des communautés locales, ainsi que les attentes des consommateurs, tout
cela peut faire du tourisme un domaine peu propice à la mise en œuvre de pratiques durables. Cet article explicite
comment “faire du tourisme” d’une manière durable grâce à la politique nationale pour un tourisme durable en
Malaisie. À l’évidence, la Malaisie dispose dans ce domaine d’un plan de développement compétitif, alliant de façon
étroite les objectifs publics, privés et ceux des ONG en matière de développement socio-économique. Il reste
cependant une lacune importante à combler en ce qui concerne l’intégration des politiques dans les éléments
externes du système touristique, au niveau macro.
