Abstract. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the relationship between tourist weather preferences, perceptions, and
weather-related activities. A conceptual model with respect to the interdependencies and relationships is proposed and discussed in
light of the results of a pilot study conducted on the French Caribbean island of La Martinique. An explorative in-situ survey that
included n= 32 holiday tourists from ‘cold’ and ‘warm’ countries examined the core variables of the model. The results demonstrated
that slight differences in climate preference existed for respondents, depending on whether they originated from a country with a cold
or a warm climate, that the activity patterns seemed to be influenced by changing weather conditions only to some extent, and that
the actual weather, which was marked by heavy rains in the first data collection period and by changeable weather in the second,
appeared to have only limited impact on return intentions. Despite the limited possibility of a pilot study, the results facilitated an
overview of the factors necessary to understand the weather-related behavior and shifts in the behavior of tourists. The core concepts
include acceptance and adaptation as dynamic psychological processes that allow an individual to cope with adverse weather
conditions. Thus, this study may serve as a basis for future research, especially with respect to the behavioral responses of leisure
tourists to predicted climate change dynamics in holiday destinations. The conceptual model may provide a useful framework for
future studies.
Résumé. Cette étude explore les relations entre perceptions du temps qu’il fait, conditions météorologiques et comportements
des vacanciers. Un modèle conceptuel est proposé, à partir d’une étude réalisée à la Martinique, aux Antilles. Une enquête
exploratoire, menée auprès d’un échantillon contrasté de trente-deux touristes “de loisirs” venant de pays au climat
“froid” ou “chaud”, a permis d’analyser les principales variables du modèle. Les résultats ont montré : qu’il y avait de
légères différences dans la préférence climatique selon que les personnes enquêtées venaient d’un pays froid ou d’un pays
chaud ; que les conditions météorologiques n’avaient qu’un impact limité sur le type d’activités pratiquées ; que le temps
qu’il faisait, qui a été marqué par des fortes pluies dans la première période d’enquête et par un temps variable dans la
deuxième, n’avait qu’un impact limité sur les intentions de retour. Malgré ses moyens limités, l’étude identifie les variables
et facteurs essentiels à la mise en œuvre d´un projet de recherche examinant la perception des conditions météorologiques
par les touristes, d’une part, et les comportements induits, d’autre part. Les principaux concepts identifiés sont l’acceptation
et l’adaptation, en tant que processus psychologiques dynamiques permettant à un individu de faire face aux mauvaises
conditions météorologiques. Cette étude peut servir de base pour de futures recherches, notamment pour l’analyse des
comportements des touristes face au changement climatique. Le modèle conceptuel peut fournir un cadre utile pour de
futures études.
